        "title":"Carbon capture and conversion using metal-organic frameworks and MOF-based materials.",
        "abstract":"Rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten human society, the natural environment, and the synergy between the two. In order to ameliorate the CO2 problem, carbon capture and conversion techniques have been proposed. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials, a relatively new class of porous materials with unique structural features, high surface areas, chemical tunability and stability, have been extensively studied with respect to their applicability to such techniques. Recently, it has become apparent that the CO2 capture capabilities of MOF-based materials significantly boost their potential toward CO2 conversion. Furthermore, MOF-based materials' well-defined structures greatly facilitate the understanding of structure-property relationships and their roles in CO2 capture and conversion. In this review, we provide a comprehensive account of significant progress in the design and synthesis of MOF-based materials, including MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives, and their application to carbon capture and conversion. Special emphases on the relationships between CO2 capture capacities of MOF-based materials and their catalytic CO2 conversion performances are discussed.",

        "title":"Cooperative carbon capture and steam regeneration with tetraamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks",
        "abstract":"Steaming out captured CO2 Although natural gas is less carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2013intensive than coal, capturing its emitted CO2 can be more challenging because combined-cycle natural gas combustion has a CO2 concentration that is only one-third of that of coal combustion and contains high concentrations of oxygen and water. Kim et al. report on a tetraamine-functionalized magnesium metal\u2013organic framework that displays two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption that leads to a high CO2 capacity and adsorption enthalpy (see the Perspective by Peh and Zhao). This material could capture CO2from humid air and could be regenerated with steam, a method that is more economical than temperature or pressure swing methods. Science, this issue p. 392; see also p. 372 Tetraamine-functionalized metal\u2013organic frameworks enable CO2 capture from humid streams, as well as steam regeneration. Natural gas has become the dominant source of electricity in the United States, and technologies capable of efficiently removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the flue emissions of natural gas\u2013fired power plants could reduce their carbon intensity. However, given the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue stream, separation of CO2 is particularly challenging. Taking inspiration from the crystal structures of diamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks exhibiting two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption, we report a family of robust tetraamine-functionalized frameworks that retain cooperativity, leading to the potential for exceptional efficiency in capturing CO2 under the extreme conditions relevant to natural gas flue emissions. The ordered, multimetal coordination of the tetraamines imparts the materials with extraordinary stability to adsorption-desorption cycling with simulated humid flue gas and enables regeneration using low-temperature steam in lieu of costly pressure or temperature swings.",

        "abstract":"Although polycrystalline metal\u2010organic framework (MOF) membranes offer several advantages over other nanoporous membranes, thus far they have not yielded good CO2 separation performance, crucial for energy\u2010efficient carbon capture. ZIF\u20108, one of the most popular MOFs, has a crystallographically determined pore aperture of 0.34 nm, ideal for CO2\/N2 and CO2\/CH4 separation; however, its flexible lattice restricts the corresponding separation selectivities to below 5. A novel postsynthetic rapid heat treatment (RHT), implemented in a few seconds at 360 \u00b0C, which drastically improves the carbon capture performance of the ZIF\u20108 membranes, is reported. Lattice stiffening is confirmed by the appearance of a temperature\u2010activated transport, attributed to a stronger interaction of gas molecules with the pore aperture, with activation energy increasing with the molecular size (CH4 > CO2 > H2). Unprecedented CO2\/CH4, CO2\/N2, and H2\/CH4 selectivities exceeding 30, 30, and 175, respectively, and complete blockage of C3H6, are achieved. Spectroscopic and X\u2010ray diffraction studies confirm that while the coordination environment and crystallinity are unaffected, lattice distortion and strain are incorporated in the ZIF\u20108 lattice, increasing the lattice stiffness. Overall, RHT treatment is a facile and versatile technique that can vastly improve the gas\u2010separation performance of the MOF membranes.",

        "abstract":"Global warming caused by burning of fossil fuels is indisputably one of mankind's greatest challenges in the 21st century. To reduce the ever\u2010increasing CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, dry solid adsorbents with large surface\u2010to\u2010volume ratio such as carbonaceous materials, zeolites, and metal\u2013organic frameworks have emerged as promising material candidates for capturing CO2. However, challenges remain because of limited CO2\/N2 selectivity and long\u2010term stability. The effective adsorption of CO2 gas (\u224812 mol kg\u22121) on individual sheets of 2D transition metal carbides (referred to as MXenes) is reported here. It is shown that exposure to N2 gas results in no adsorption, consistent with first\u2010principles calculations. The adsorption efficiency combined with the CO2\/N2 selectivity, together with a chemical and thermal stability, identifies the archetype Ti3C2 MXene as a new material for carbon capture (CC) applications.",

        "abstract":"Description A hydrophobic CO2 physisorbent Most materials for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture of fossil fuel combustion, such as amines, rely on strong chemisorption interactions that are highly selective but can incur a large energy penalty to release CO2. Lin et al. show that a zinc-based metal organic framework material can physisorb CO2 and incurs a lower regeneration penalty. Its binding site at the center of the pores precludes the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks between water molecules. This durable material can preferentially adsorb CO2 at 40% relative humidity and maintains its performance under flue gas conditions of 150\u00b0C. \u2014PDS A metal-organic framework captures CO2 with high capacity and selectivity over steam with only a modest regeneration penalty. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid sorbents for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture face the challenge of merging efficient capture with economical regeneration in a durable, scalable material. Zinc-based Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20) physisorbs CO2 with high capacity but is also selective over water. Competitive separations on structured CALF-20 show not just preferential CO2 physisorption below 40% relative humidity but also suppression of water sorption by CO2, which was corroborated by computational modeling. CALF-20 has a low enthalpic regeneration penalty and shows durability to steam (>450,000 cycles) and wet acid gases. It can be prepared in one step, formed as composite materials, and its synthesis can be scaled to multikilogram batches.",

        "title":"Carbon Capture by Metal Oxides: Unleashing the Potential of the (111) Facet.",
        "abstract":"Solid metal oxides for carbon capture exhibit reduced adsorption capacity following high-temperature exposure, due to surface area reduction by sintering. Furthermore, only low-coordinate corner\/edge sites on the thermodynamically stable (100) facet display favorable binding toward CO2, providing inherently low capacity. The (111) facet, however, exhibits a high concentration of low-coordinate sites. In this work, MgO(111) nanosheets displayed high capacity for CO2, as well as a \u223c65% increase in capacity despite a \u223c30% reduction in surface area following sintering (0.77 mmol g-1 @ 227 m2 g-1 vs 1.28 mmol g-1 @ 154 m2 g-1). These results, unique to MgO(111), suggest intrinsic differences in the effects of sintering on basic site retention. Spectroscopic and computational investigations provided a new structure-activity insight: the importance of high-temperature activation to unleash the capacity of the polar (111) facet of MgO. In summary, we present the first example of a faceted sorbent for carbon capture and challenge the assumption that sintering is necessarily a negative process; here we leverage high-temperature conditions for facet-dependent surface activation.",

        "title":"Partitioning MOF-5 into Confined and Hydrophobic Compartments for Carbon Capture under Humid Conditions.",
        "abstract":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), by virtue of their remarkable uptake capability, selectivity, and ease of regeneration, hold great promise for carbon capture from fossil fuel combustion. However, their stability toward moisture together with the competitive adsorption of water against CO2 drastically dampens their capacity and selectivity under real humid flue gas conditions. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to tackle the above obstacles by partitioning the channels of MOFs into confined, hydrophobic compartments by in situ polymerization of aromatic acetylenes. Specifically, polynaphthylene was formed via a radical reaction inside the channels of MOF-5 and served as partitions without altering the underlying structure of the framework. Compared with pristine MOF-5, the resultant material (PN@MOF-5) exhibits a doubled CO2 capacity (78 vs 38 cm(3)\/g at 273 K and 1 bar), 23 times higher CO2\/N2 selectivity (212 vs 9), and significantly improved moisture stability. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity can be largely maintained (>90%) under humid conditions during cycles. This strategy can be applied to other MOF materials and may shed light on the design of new MOF-polymer materials with tunable pore sizes and environments to promote their practical applications.",
