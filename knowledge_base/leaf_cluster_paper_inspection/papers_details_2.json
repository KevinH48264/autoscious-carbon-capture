        "abstract":"Rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten human society, the natural environment, and the synergy between the two. In order to ameliorate the CO2 problem, carbon capture and conversion techniques have been proposed. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials, a relatively new class of porous materials with unique structural features, high surface areas, chemical tunability and stability, have been extensively studied with respect to their applicability to such techniques. Recently, it has become apparent that the CO2 capture capabilities of MOF-based materials significantly boost their potential toward CO2 conversion. Furthermore, MOF-based materials' well-defined structures greatly facilitate the understanding of structure-property relationships and their roles in CO2 capture and conversion. In this review, we provide a comprehensive account of significant progress in the design and synthesis of MOF-based materials, including MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives, and their application to carbon capture and conversion. Special emphases on the relationships between CO2 capture capacities of MOF-based materials and their catalytic CO2 conversion performances are discussed.",

        "abstract":"Steaming out captured CO2 Although natural gas is less carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2013intensive than coal, capturing its emitted CO2 can be more challenging because combined-cycle natural gas combustion has a CO2 concentration that is only one-third of that of coal combustion and contains high concentrations of oxygen and water. Kim et al. report on a tetraamine-functionalized magnesium metal\u2013organic framework that displays two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption that leads to a high CO2 capacity and adsorption enthalpy (see the Perspective by Peh and Zhao). This material could capture CO2from humid air and could be regenerated with steam, a method that is more economical than temperature or pressure swing methods. Science, this issue p. 392; see also p. 372 Tetraamine-functionalized metal\u2013organic frameworks enable CO2 capture from humid streams, as well as steam regeneration. Natural gas has become the dominant source of electricity in the United States, and technologies capable of efficiently removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the flue emissions of natural gas\u2013fired power plants could reduce their carbon intensity. However, given the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue stream, separation of CO2 is particularly challenging. Taking inspiration from the crystal structures of diamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks exhibiting two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption, we report a family of robust tetraamine-functionalized frameworks that retain cooperativity, leading to the potential for exceptional efficiency in capturing CO2 under the extreme conditions relevant to natural gas flue emissions. The ordered, multimetal coordination of the tetraamines imparts the materials with extraordinary stability to adsorption-desorption cycling with simulated humid flue gas and enables regeneration using low-temperature steam in lieu of costly pressure or temperature swings.",

For adsorption-based gas separations and carbon capture, recent efforts have been directed toward the development of multiscale and performance-based screening workflows where we can go from the atomistic structure of an adsorbent to its equilibrium and transport properties at different scales, and eventually to its separation performance at the process level. The objective of this work is to review the current status of this new approach, discuss its potential and impact on the field of materials screening, and highlight the challenges that limit its application. We compile and introduce all the elements required for the development, implementation, and operation of multiscale workflows, hence providing a useful practical guide and a comprehensive source of reference to the scientific communities who work in this area. Our review includes information about available materials databases, state-of-the-art molecular simulation and process modeling tools, and a complete catalogue of data and parameters that are required at each stage of the multiscale screening.

        "abstract":"Although polycrystalline metal\u2010organic framework (MOF) membranes offer several advantages over other nanoporous membranes, thus far they have not yielded good CO2 separation performance, crucial for energy\u2010efficient carbon capture. ZIF\u20108, one of the most popular MOFs, has a crystallographically determined pore aperture of 0.34 nm, ideal for CO2\/N2 and CO2\/CH4 separation; however, its flexible lattice restricts the corresponding separation selectivities to below 5. A novel postsynthetic rapid heat treatment (RHT), implemented in a few seconds at 360 \u00b0C, which drastically improves the carbon capture performance of the ZIF\u20108 membranes, is reported. Lattice stiffening is confirmed by the appearance of a temperature\u2010activated transport, attributed to a stronger interaction of gas molecules with the pore aperture, with activation energy increasing with the molecular size (CH4 > CO2 > H2). Unprecedented CO2\/CH4, CO2\/N2, and H2\/CH4 selectivities exceeding 30, 30, and 175, respectively, and complete blockage of C3H6, are achieved. Spectroscopic and X\u2010ray diffraction studies confirm that while the coordination environment and crystallinity are unaffected, lattice distortion and strain are incorporated in the ZIF\u20108 lattice, increasing the lattice stiffness. Overall, RHT treatment is a facile and versatile technique that can vastly improve the gas\u2010separation performance of the MOF membranes.",

This durable material can preferentially adsorb CO2 at 40% relative humidity and maintains its performance under flue gas conditions of 150\u00b0C. \u2014PDS A metal-organic framework captures CO2 with high capacity and selectivity over steam with only a modest regeneration penalty. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid sorbents for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture face the challenge of merging efficient capture with economical regeneration in a durable, scalable material. Zinc-based Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20) physisorbs CO2 with high capacity but is also selective over water. Competitive separations on structured CALF-20 show not just preferential CO2 physisorption below 40% relative humidity but also suppression of water sorption by CO2, which was corroborated by computational modeling. CALF-20 has a low enthalpic regeneration penalty and shows durability to steam (>450,000 cycles) and wet acid gases.

        "abstract":"Climate change due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (e.g., combustion of fossil fuels) represents one of the most profound environmental disasters of this century. Equipping power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has the potential to reduce current worldwide CO2 emissions. However, existing CCS schemes (i.e., amine scrubbing) are highly energy-intensive. The urgent abatement of CO2 emissions relies on the development of new, efficient technologies to capture CO2 from existing power plants. Membrane-based CO2 separation is an attractive technology that meets many of the requirements for energy-efficient industrial carbon capture. Within this domain, thin-film composite (TFC) membranes are particularly attractive, providing high gas permeance in comparison with conventional thicker (\u223c50 \u03bcm) dense membranes. TFC membranes are usually composed of three layers: (1) a bottom porous support layer; (2) a highly permeable intermediate gutter layer; and (3) a thin (<1 \u03bcm) species-selective top layer. A key challenge in the development of TFC membranes has been to simultaneously maximize the transmembrane gas permeance of the assembled membrane (by minimizing the gas resistance of each layer) while maintaining high gas-specific selectivity. In this Account, we provide an overview of our recent development of high-performance TFC membrane materials as well as insights into the unique fabrication strategies employed for the selective layer and gutter layer. Optimization of each layer of the membrane assembly individually results in significant improvements in overall membrane performance. First, incorporating nanosized fillers into the selective layer (poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymers) and reducing its thickness (to ca. 50 nm) through continuous assembly of polymers technology yields\u00a0major improvements in CO2 permeance without loss of selectivity. Second, we focus on optimization of the middle gutter layer of TFC membranes. The development of enhanced gutter layers employing two- and three-dimensional metal-organic framework materials leads to considerable improvements in both CO2 permeance and selectivity compared with traditional poly(dimethylsiloxane) materials. Third, incorporation of a porous, flexible support layer culminates in a mechanically robust high-performance TFC membrane design that exhibits unprecedented CO2 separation performance and holds significant potential for industrial CO2 capture. Alternative strategies are also emerging, whereby the selective layer and gutter layer may be combined for enhanced membrane efficiency. This Account highlights the CO2 capture performance, current challenges, and future research directions in designing high-performance TFC membranes.",

However, their stability toward moisture together with the competitive adsorption of water against CO2 drastically dampens their capacity and selectivity under real humid flue gas conditions. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to tackle the above obstacles by partitioning the channels of MOFs into confined, hydrophobic compartments by in situ polymerization of aromatic acetylenes. Specifically, polynaphthylene was formed via a radical reaction inside the channels of MOF-5 and served as partitions without altering the underlying structure of the framework. Compared with pristine MOF-5, the resultant material (PN@MOF-5) exhibits a doubled CO2 capacity (78 vs 38 cm(3)\/g at 273 K and 1 bar), 23 times higher CO2\/N2 selectivity (212 vs 9), and significantly improved moisture stability. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity can be largely maintained (>90%) under humid conditions during cycles.
