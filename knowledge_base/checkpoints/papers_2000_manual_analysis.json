We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m \u20131 ) and \u2013690 Nm \u20131 , respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m \u20131 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = \u20132.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of \u03c3 int = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.",

The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.",

Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.",

This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing.

    "text":"The Chemistry and Applications of Metal-Organic Frameworks. Background Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are made by linking inorganic and organic units by strong bonds (reticular synthesis). The flexibility with which the constituents\u2019 geometry, size, and functionality can be varied has led to more than 20,000 different MOFs being reported and studied within the past decade. The organic units are ditopic or polytopic organic carboxylates (and other similar negatively charged molecules), which, when linked to metal-containing units, yield architecturally robust crystalline MOF structures with a typical porosity of greater than 50% of the MOF crystal volume. The surface area values of such MOFs typically range from 1000 to 10,000 m 2 \/g, thus exceeding those of traditional porous materials such as zeolites and carbons. To date, MOFs with permanent porosity are more extensive in their variety and multiplicity than any other class of porous materials. These aspects have made MOFs ideal candidates for storage of fuels (hydrogen and methane), capture of carbon dioxide, and catalysis applications, to mention a few. Advances The ability to vary the size and nature of MOF structures without changing their underlying topology gave rise to the isoreticular principle and its application in making MOFs with the largest pore aperture (98 \u00c5) and lowest density (0.13 g\/cm 3 ). This has allowed for the selective inclusion of large molecules (e.g., vitamin B 12 ) and proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein) and the exploitation of the pores as reaction vessels. Along these lines, the thermal and chemical stability of many MOFs has made them amenable to postsynthetic covalent organic and metal-complex functionalization. These capabilities enable substantial enhancement of gas storage in MOFs and have led to their extensive study in the catalysis of organic reactions, activation of small molecules (hydrogen, methane, and water), gas separation, biomedical imaging, and proton, electron, and ion conduction. At present, methods are being developed for making nanocrystals and supercrystals of MOFs for their incorporation into devices. Outlook The precise control over the assembly of MOFs is expected to propel this field further into new realms of synthetic chemistry in which far more sophisticated materials may be accessed. For example, materials can be envisaged as having (i) compartments linked together to operate separately, yet function synergistically; (ii) dexterity to carry out parallel operations; (iii) ability to count, sort, and code information; and (iv) capability of dynamics with high fidelity. Efforts in this direction are already being undertaken through the introduction of a large number of different functional groups within the pores of MOFs. This yields multivariate frameworks in which the varying arrangement of functionalities gives rise to materials that offer a synergistic combination of properties. Future work will involve the assembly of chemical structures from many different types of building unit, such that the structures\u2019 function is dictated by the heterogeneity of the specific arrangement of their constituents.",

Over a wide range of physiological conditions the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport was found to be directly proportional to the product of the photochemical fluorescence quenching (qQ) and the efficiency of excitation capture by open Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centres (Fv\/Fm).

This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO 2 levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.",

Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 A in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 A in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds.

The functional composition of microbial community samples from several environments is predicted based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data. Profiling phylogenetic marker genes, such as the 16S rRNA gene, is a key tool for studies of microbial communities but does not provide direct evidence of a community's functional capabilities. Here we describe PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and function are sufficiently linked that this 'predictive metagenomic' approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys are currently available.",

Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.",

Compared to conventionally used microporous inorganic materials such as zeolites, these organic structures have the potential for more flexible rational design, through control of the architecture and functionalization of the pores. So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest molecules, such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field14,15. Here we report the synthesis of a metal\u2013organic framework which remains crystalline, as evidenced by X-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300?\u00b0C. This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chemistry, where an organic dicarboxylate linker is used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates. The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore volume than most porous crystalline zeolites. This simple and potentially universal design strategy is currently being pursued in the synthesis of new phases and composites, and for gas-storage applications.",

    "text":"UniFrac: a New Phylogenetic Method for Comparing Microbial Communities. ABSTRACT We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.",

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Autophagy principally serves an adaptive role to protect organisms against diverse pathologies, including infections, cancer, neurodegeneration, aging, and heart disease. However, in certain experimental disease settings, the self-cannibalistic or, paradoxically, even the prosurvival functions of autophagy may be deleterious. This Review summarizes recent advances in understanding the physiological functions of autophagy and its possible roles in the causation and prevention of human diseases. Fasting has been an integral part of health and healing practices throughout the recorded history of mankind. This ancient tradition may be partially rooted in a cellular process we are now beginning to understand in modern scientific terms. One of the most evolutionarily conserved cellular responses to organismal fasting is the activation of the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy, a process in which the cell self-digests its own components. This self-digestion not only provides nutrients to maintain vital cellular functions during fasting but also can rid the cell of superfluous or damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and invading microorganisms. Interestingly, self-digestion by autophagy\u2014a process that is potently triggered by fasting\u2014is now emerging as a central biological pathway that functions to promote health and longevity. Autophagy (from the Greek, \u201cauto\u201d oneself, \u201cphagy\u201d to eat) refers to any cellular degradative pathway that involves the delivery of cytoplasmic cargo to the lysosome. At least three forms have been identified\u2014chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy, and macroautophagy\u2014that differ with respect to their physiological functions and the mode of cargo delivery to the lysosome. This Review will focus on macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy), the major regulated catabolic mechanism that eukaryotic cells use to degrade long-lived proteins and organelles. This form of autophagy involves the delivery of cytoplasmic cargo sequestered inside double-membrane vesicles to the lysosome (Figure 1). Initial steps include the formation (vesicle nucleation) and expansion (vesicle elongation) of an isolation membrane, which is also called a phagophore. The edges of the phagophore then fuse (vesicle completion) to form the autophagosome, a double-membraned vesicle that sequesters the cytoplasmic material. This is followed by fusion of the autophagosome with a lysosome to form an autolysosome where the captured material, together with the inner membrane, is degraded (Figure 1). Autophagy occurs at low basal levels in virtually all cells to perform homeostatic functions such as protein and organelle turnover. It is rapidly upregulated when cells need to generate intracellular nutrients and energy, for example, during starvation, growth factor withdrawal, or high bioenergetic demands. Autophagy is also upregulated when cells are preparing to undergo structural remodeling such as during developmental transitions or to rid themselves of damaging cytoplasmic components, for example, during oxidative stress, infection, or protein aggregate accumulation. Nutritional status, hormonal factors, and other cues like temperature, oxygen concentrations, and cell density are important in the control of autophagy. The molecular cascade that regulates and executes autophagy has been the subject of recent, comprehensive reviews (Klionsky, 2007Klionsky D.J.

Potential therapeutic applications of autophagy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). One of the key regulators of autophagy is the target of rapamycin, TOR kinase, which is the major inhibitory signal that shuts off autophagy in the presence of growth factors and abundant nutrients. The class I PI3K\/Akt signaling molecules link receptor tyrosine kinases to TOR activation and thereby repress autophagy in response to insulin-like and other growth factor signals (Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J.

Some of the other regulatory molecules that control autophagy include 5\u2032-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which responds to low energy; the eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which responds to nutrient starvation, double-stranded RNA, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; BH3-only proteins that contain a Bcl-2 homology-3 (BH3) domain and disrupt Bcl-2\/Bcl-XL inhibition of the Beclin 1\/class III PI3K complex; the tumor suppressor protein, p53; death-associated protein kinases (DAPk); the ER-membrane-associated protein, Ire-1; the stress-activated kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase; the inositol-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R); GTPases; Erk1\/2; ceramide; and calcium (Criollo et al., 2007Criollo A.

Potential therapeutic applications of autophagy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Downstream of TOR kinase, there are more than 20 genes in yeast (known as the ATG genes) that encode proteins (many of which are evolutionarily conserved) that are essential for the execution of autophagy (Mizushima and Klionsky, 2007Mizushima N. Klionsky D. Protein turnover via autophagy: implications for metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). These include a protein serine\/threonine kinase complex that responds to upstream signals such as TOR kinase (Atg1, Atg13, Atg17), a lipid kinase signaling complex that mediates vesicle nucleation (Atg6, Atg14, Vps34, and Vps15), two ubiquitin-like conjugation pathways that mediate vesicle expansion (the Atg8 and Atg12 systems), a recycling pathway that mediates the disassembly of Atg proteins from mature autophagosomes (Atg2, Atg9, Atg18), and vacuolar permeases that permit the efflux of amino acids from the degradative compartment (Atg22). In mammals, proteins that act more generally in lysosomal function are required for proper fusion with autophagosomes\u2014such as the lysosomal transmembrane proteins, LAMP-2 and CLN3\u2014and for the degradation of autophagosomal contents, such as the lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsins B, D, and L (Table 1).Table 1Phenotypes of Mice with Mutations in Autophagy GenesGenotype (Organ)PhenotypeReferenceMutations Affecting Formation of Autophagosomesatg4C\u2212\/\u2212 (all tissues)Diaphragm-specific autophagy defect during starvation.

Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation of yeast Atg8 or mammalian LC3 during autophagy results in a nonsoluble form of Atg8 (Atg8-PE) or LC3 (LC3-II) that stably associates with the autophagosomal membrane (Figure 1). Consequently, autophagy can be detected biochemically (by assessing the generation of Atg8-PE or LC3-II) or microscopically (by observing the localization pattern of fluorescently tagged Atg8 or LC3) (Mizushima and Klionsky, 2007Mizushima N. Klionsky D. Protein turnover via autophagy: implications for metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These approaches must be coupled with ancillary measures to discriminate between two physiologically distinct scenarios\u2014increased autophagic flux without impairment in autophagic turnover (i.e., an increased \u201con-rate\u201d) versus impaired clearance of autophagosomes (i.e., a \u201cdecreased off-rate\u201d), which results in a functional defect in autophagic catabolism (Figure 2). Autophagy can be pharmacologically induced by inhibiting negative regulators such as TOR with rapamycin (Rubinsztein et al., 2007Rubinsztein D.C. Gestwicki J.E. Murphy L.O. Klionsky D.J. Potential therapeutic applications of autophagy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar); the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL that bind to the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg6, Beclin 1, with ABT-737 (Maiuri et al., 2007bMaiuri M.C. Le Toumelin G. Criollo A. Rain J.C. Gautier F. Juin P. Tasdemir E. Pierron G. Troulinaki K. Tavernarakis N. et al.Functional and physical interaction between Bcl-X(L) and a BH3-like domain in Beclin-1.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar); IP3R with xestospongin B, an IP3R antagonist; or lithium, a molecule that lowers IP3 levels (Criollo et al., 2007Criollo A. Maiuri M.C. Tasdemir E. Vitale I. Fiebig A.A. Andrews D. Molgo J. Diaz J. Lavandero S. Harper F. et al.Regulation of autophagy by the inositol trisphosphate receptor.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Autophagy can be pharmacologically inhibited by targeting the class III PI3K involved in autophagosome formation with 3-methyladenine or by targeting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, using inhibitors of the lysosomal proton pump such as bafilomycin A1 or lysosomotropic alkalines such as chloroquine and 3-hydroxychloroquine (Rubinsztein et al., 2007Rubinsztein D.C. Gestwicki J.E. Murphy L.O. Klionsky D.J. Potential therapeutic applications of autophagy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). It should be noted that all of these pharmacological agents lack specificity for the autophagy pathway. Therefore, although some of these agents such as rapamycin, lithium, and chloroquine are clinically available and may be helpful for treating diseases associated with autophagy deregulation, genetic approaches to inhibiting autophagy\u2014for example, knockout of ATG genes by homologous recombination or knockdown by small-interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2014have yielded more conclusive information about the biologic roles of autophagy in health and disease. Autophagy is activated as an adaptive catabolic process in response to different forms of metabolic stress, including nutrient deprivation, growth factor depletion, and hypoxia. This bulk form of degradation generates free amino and fatty acids that can be recycled in a cell-autonomous fashion or delivered systemically to distant sites within the organism. Presumably, the amino acids generated are used for the de novo synthesis of proteins that are essential for stress adaptation. The molecular basis for the recycling function of autophagy has only recently begun to be defined with the identification of yeast Atg22 as a vacuolar permease required for the efflux of amino acids resulting from autophagic degradation (Mizushima and Klionsky, 2007Mizushima N. Klionsky D. Protein turnover via autophagy: implications for metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 19-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the recycling function of autophagy is conserved in mammals and other higher organisms, although direct data proving this concept are lacking. The amino acids liberated from autophagic degradation can be further processed and, together with the fatty acids, used by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to maintain cellular ATP production. The importance of autophagy in fueling the TCA cycle is supported by studies showing that certain phenotypes of autophagy-deficient cells can be reversed by supplying them with a TCA substrate such as pyruvate (or its membrane-permeable derivative methylpyruvate). For example, methylpyruvate can maintain ATP production and survival in growth factor-deprived autophagy-deficient cells that would otherwise quickly die (Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Growth factor regulation of autophagy and cell survival in the absence of apoptosis.Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). It can also restore ATP production, the generation of engulfment signals, and effective corpse removal in autophagy-deficient cells during embryonic development (Qu et al., 2007Qu X. Zou Z. Sun Q. Luby-Phelps K. Cheng P. Hogan R.N. Gilpin C. Levine B. Autophagy gene-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells during embryonic development.Cell. 2007; 128: 931-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This role of autophagy in maintaining macromolecular synthesis and ATP production is likely a critical mechanism underlying its evolutionarily conserved prosurvival function. Gene knockout or knockdown studies in diverse phyla provide strong evidence that autophagy plays an essential function in organismal survival during nutrient stress (Maiuri et al., 2007aMaiuri M.C. Zalckvar E. Kimchi A. Kroemer G. Self-eating and self-killing: crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking ATG genes display reduced tolerance to nitrogen or carbon deprivation and are defective in starvation-induced sporulation. Similarly, null mutations in ATG genes in slime molds limit viability and differentiation during nutrient deprivation. Loss-of-function mutations in ATG genes in plants reduce tolerance to nitrogen or carbon depletion, resulting in enhanced chlorosis, reduced seed set, and accelerated leaf senescence (Bassham et al., 2006Bassham D.C. Laporte M. Marty F. Moriyasu Y. Ohsumi Y. Olsen L.J. Yoshimoto K. Autophagy in development and stress responses of plants.Autophagy. 2006; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of atg genes in nematodes decreases survival during starvation (Kang et al., 2007Kang C. You Y.-J. Avery L. Dual roles of autophagy in the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Autophagy also enables mammals to withstand nutrient depletion (Table 1). Mice lacking either atg5\u2212\/\u2212 or atg7\u2212\/\u2212 are born at normal Mendelian ratios yet die within hours after birth, presumably due to their inability to adapt to the neonatal starvation period. Thus, a critical physiological role of autophagy appears to be the mobilization of intracellular energy resources to meet cellular and organismal demands for metabolic substrates. The requirement for this function of autophagy is not limited to settings of nutrient starvation. Because growth factors are often required for nutrient uptake, loss of growth factor signaling can result in reduced intracellular metabolite concentrations and activation of autophagy-dependent survival mechanisms (Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Growth factor regulation of autophagy and cell survival in the absence of apoptosis.Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). It is also possible that in certain settings, especially when cells suddenly have high metabolic needs, autophagy may be needed in a cell-autonomous fashion to generate sufficient intracellular metabolic substrates to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. This hypothesis may explain why there are high levels of autophagy in the mouse heart and diaphragm immediately following birth (Kuma et al., 2004Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. The role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). The repertoire of routine housekeeping functions performed by autophagy includes the elimination of defective proteins and organelles, the prevention of abnormal protein aggregate accumulation, and the removal of intracellular pathogens. Such functions are likely critical for autophagy-mediated protection against aging, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infection. Although some of these functions overlap with those of the ubiquitin-proteosome system\u2014the other major cellular proteolytic system\u2014the autophagy pathway is uniquely capable of degrading entire organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ER as well as intact intracellular microorganisms. Further, the relative role of the autophagy-lysosome system in protein quality control\u2014i.e., in preventing the intracellular accumulation of altered and misfolded proteins\u2014may be greater than previously anticipated. Tissue-specific disruption of ATG genes has revealed a critical role for basal autophagy in protein quality control in murine postmitotic cells (Table 1). Atg7 deletion in hepatocytes, atg5 and atg7 deletion in neurons, and atg5 deletion in cardiomyocytes result in the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in inclusion bodies that are associated with cellular degeneration. Such abnormalities have not been reported for atg5-deficient dendritic cells or T lymphocytes, perhaps because autophagy is less important for the waste management of rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, the underlying mechanism for the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in certain autophagy knockout mouse tissues remains unknown. Cytoplasmic accumulation of diffuse ubiquitinated proteins precedes the accumulation of aggregates in atg5-deficient neurons (Hara et al., 2006Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Suppression of basal autophagy in neural cells causes neurodegenerative disease in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Thus, aggregate formation may be a secondary result of a general defect in protein turnover rather than a failure of basal autophagy to clear aggregates that are formed constitutively in normal conditions (Mizushima and Klionsky, 2007Mizushim",

    "text":"Comparison of multiple Amber force fields and development of improved protein backbone parameters. The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of \u03b1-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of \u201cAmber\u201d force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone \u03c6\/\u03c8 dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the \u03c6\/\u03c8 dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems.

    "text":"Economic Growth and the Environment. We examine the reduced-form relationship between per capita income and various environmental indicators. Our study covers four types of indicators: urban air pollution, the state of the oxygen regime in river basins, fecal contamination of ri'ver basins, and contamination of river basins by heavy metals. We find no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth. Rather, for most indicators, economic growth brings an initial phase of deterioration followed by a subsequent phase of improvement. The turning points for the different pollutants vary, but in most cases they come before a country reaches a per capita income of $8000. I. INTRODUCTION Will continued economic growth bring ever greater harm to the earth's environment? Or do increases in income and wealth sow the seeds for the amelioration of ecological problems? The answers to these questions are critical for the design of appropriate development strategies for lesser developed countries. Exhaustible and renewable natural resources serve as inputs into the production of many goods and services. If the composition of output and the methods of production were immutable, then damage to the environment would be inextricably linked to the scale of global economic activity. But substantial evidence suggests that development gives rise to a structural transformation in what an economy produces (see Syrquin [1989]). And societies have shown remarkable ingenuity in harnessing new technologies to conserve scarce resources. In principle, the forces leading to change in the composition and techniques of production may be sufficiently strong to more than offset the adverse effects of increased economic activity on the environment. In this paper we address this empirical issue using panel data on ambient pollution levels in many countries. Examination of the empirical relationship between national income and measures of environmental quality began with our *We thank the Ford Foundation, the Sloan Foundation, the John S.

Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits.

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W\/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.",

    "text":"Separate visual pathways for perception and action. Accumulating neuropsychological, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence suggests that the neural substrates of visual perception may be quite distinct from those underlying the visual control of actions. In other words, the set of object descriptions that permit identification and recognition may be computed independently of the set of descriptions that allow an observer to shape the hand appropriately to pick up an object. We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.",

    "text":"Biological effects of essential oils \u2013 A review. Since the middle ages, essential oils have been widely used for bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, insecticidal, medicinal and cosmetic applications, especially nowadays in pharmaceutical, sanitary, cosmetic, agricultural and food industries. Because of the mode of extraction, mostly by distillation from aromatic plants, they contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids, phenol-derived aromatic components and aliphatic components. In vitro physicochemical assays characterise most of them as antioxidants. However, recent work shows that in eukaryotic cells, essential oils can act as prooxidants affecting inner cell membranes and organelles such as mitochondria. Depending on type and concentration, they exhibit cytotoxic effects on living cells but are usually non-genotoxic. In some cases, changes in intracellular redox potential and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by essential oils can be associated with their capacity to exert antigenotoxic effects. These findings suggest that, at least in part, the encountered beneficial effects of essential oils are due to prooxidant effects on the cellular level.",

    "text":"Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions. The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.",

    "text":"Nitric oxide, superoxide, and peroxynitrite: the good, the bad, and ugly. Nitric oxide contrasts with most intercellular messengers because it diffuses rapidly and isotropically through most tissues with little reaction but cannot be transported through the vasculature due to rapid destruction by oxyhemoglobin. The rapid diffusion of nitric oxide between cells allows it to locally integrate the responses of blood vessels to turbulence, modulate synaptic plasticity in neurons, and control the oscillatory behavior of neuronal networks. Nitric oxide is not necessarily short lived and is intrinsically no more reactive than oxygen. The reactivity of nitric oxide per se has been greatly overestimated in vitro because no drain is provided to remove nitric oxide. Nitric oxide persists in solution for several minutes in micromolar concentrations before it reacts with oxygen to form much stronger oxidants like nitrogen dioxide. Nitric oxide is removed within seconds in vivo by diffusion over 100 microns through tissues to enter red blood cells and react with oxyhemoglobin. The direct toxicity of nitric oxide is modest but is greatly enhanced by reacting with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Nitric oxide is the only biological molecule produced in high enough concentrations to out-compete superoxide dismutase for superoxide. Peroxynitrite reacts relatively slowly with most biological molecules, making peroxynitrite a selective oxidant. Peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine in proteins to create nitrotyrosines, leaving a footprint detectable in vivo. Nitration of structural proteins, including neurofilaments and actin, can disrupt filament assembly with major pathological consequences. Antibodies to nitrotyrosine have revealed nitration in human atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, septic and distressed lung, inflammatory bowel disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

    "text":"USING STABLE ISOTOPES TO ESTIMATE TROPHIC POSITION: MODELS, METHODS, AND ASSUMPTIONS. The stable isotopes of nitrogen (\u03b415N) and carbon (\u03b413C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how \u03b415N and \u03b413C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of \u03b415N is 3.4\u2030 (1 sd = 1\u2030) and of \u03b413C is 0.4\u2030 (1 sd = 1.3\u2030), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of \u03b415N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of \u03b413C when \u03b413C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.",

Two large samples of undergraduate students completed mindfulness questionnaires and measures of other constructs. Psychometric properties of the mindfulness questionnaires were examined, including internal consistency and convergent and discriminant relationships with other variables. Factor analyses of the combined pool of items from the mindfulness questionnaires suggested that collectively they contain five clear, interpretable facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified factors are components of an overall mindfulness construct and that the factor structure of mindfulness may vary with meditation experience. Mindfulness facets were shown to be differentially correlated in expected ways with several other constructs and to have incremental validity in the prediction of psychological symptoms. Findings suggest that conceptualizing mindfulness as a multifaceted construct is helpful in understanding its components and its relationships with other variables.",

    "text":"Convective Transport in Nanofluids. Nanofluids are engineered colloids made of a base fluid and nanoparticles (1-100nm). Nanofluids have higher thermal conductivity and single-phase heat transfer coefficients than their base fluids. In particular, the heat transfer coefficient increases appear to go beyond the mere thermal-conductivity effect, and cannot be predicted by traditional pure-fluid correlations such as Dittus-Boelter\u2019s. In the nanofluid literature this behavior is generally attributed to thermal dispersion and intensified turbulence, brought about by nanoparticle motion. To test the validity of this assumption, we have considered seven slip mechanisms that can produce a relative velocity between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. These are inertia, Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, Magnus effect, fluid drainage, and gravity. We concluded that, of these seven, only Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis are important slip mechanisms in nanofluids. Based on this finding, we developed a two-component four-equation nonhomogeneous equilibrium model for mass, momentum, and heat transport in nanofluids. A nondimensional analysis of the equations suggests that energy transfer by nanoparticle dispersion is negligible, and thus cannot explain the abnormal heat transfer coefficient increases. Furthermore, a comparison of the nanoparticle and turbulent eddy time and length scales clearly indicates that the nanoparticles move homogeneously with the fluid in the presence of turbulent eddies, so an effect on turbulence intensity is also doubtful. Thus, we propose an alternative explanation for the abnormal heat transfer coefficient increases: the nanofluid properties may vary significantly within the boundary layer because of the effect of the temperature gradient and thermophoresis. For a heated fluid, these effects can result in a significant decrease of viscosity within the boundary layer, thus leading to heat transfer enhancement. A correlation structure that captures these effects is proposed.",

Objective evaluation of the activity of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of fundamental importance for the development of promising energy conversion technologies including integrated solar water-splitting devices, water electrolyzers, and Li-air batteries. However, current methods employed to evaluate oxygen-evolving catalysts are not standardized, making it difficult to compare the activity and stability of these materials. We report a protocol for evaluating the activity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency of electrodeposited oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. In particular, we focus on methods for determining electrochemically active surface area and measuring electrocatalytic activity and stability under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm\u20132 per geometric area, approximately the current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device. Utilizing the aforementioned surface area measurements, one can determine electrocatalyst turnover frequencies. The reported protocol was used to examine the oxygen-evolution activity of the following systems in acidic and alkaline solutions: CoOx, CoPi, CoFeOx, NiOx, NiCeOx, NiCoOx, NiCuOx, NiFeOx, and NiLaOx. The oxygen-evolving activity of an electrodeposited IrOx catalyst was also investigated for comparison. Two general observations are made from comparing the catalytic performance of the OER catalysts investigated: (1) in alkaline solution, every non-noble metal system achieved 10 mA cm\u20132 current densities at similar operating overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V, and (2) every system but IrOx was unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.",

The search was initially restricted to articles published during or after 1990, but we later included relevant articles published in 1980 to December 31, 2002. Prevalence and relative risk were identified during the literature search. We used 2000 mortality data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the causes and number of deaths. The estimates of cause of death were computed by multiplying estimates of the cause-attributable fraction of preventable deaths with the total mortality data.Actual causes of death.The leading causes of death in 2000 were tobacco (435 000 deaths; 18.1% of total US deaths), poor diet and physical inactivity (365 000 deaths; 15.2%) [corrected], and alcohol consumption (85 000 deaths; 3.5%). Other actual causes of death were microbial agents (75 000), toxic agents (55 000), motor vehicle crashes (43 000), incidents involving firearms (29 000), sexual behaviors (20 000), and illicit use of drugs (17 000).These analyses show that smoking remains the leading cause of mortality.

Most prior studies have found that substituting biofuels for gasoline will reduce greenhouse gases because biofuels sequester carbon through the growth of the feedstock. These analyses have failed to count the carbon emissions that occur as farmers worldwide respond to higher prices and convert forest and grassland to new cropland to replace the grain (or cropland) diverted to biofuels. By using a worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions from land-use change, we found that corn-based ethanol, instead of producing a 20% savings, nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years. Biofuels from switchgrass, if grown on U.S. corn lands, increase emissions by 50%. This result raises concerns about large biofuel mandates and highlights the value of using waste products.",

Plant responses to salinity stress are reviewed with emphasis on molecular mechanisms of signal transduction and on the physiological consequences of altered gene expression that affect biochemical reactions downstream of stress sensing. We make extensive use of comparisons with model organisms, halophytic plants, and yeast, which provide a paradigm for many responses to salinity exhibited by stress-sensitive plants. Among biochemical responses, we emphasize osmolyte biosynthesis and function, water flux control, and membrane transport of ions for maintenance and re-establishment of homeostasis. The advances in understanding the effectiveness of stress responses, and distinctions between pathology and adaptive advantage, are increasingly based on transgenic plant and mutant analyses, in particular the analysis of Arabidopsis mutants defective in elements of stress signal transduction pathways. We summarize evidence for plant stress signaling systems, some of which have components analogous to those that regulate osmotic stress responses of yeast. There is evidence also of signaling cascades that are not known to exist in the unicellular eukaryote, some that presumably function in intercellular coordination or regulation of effector genes in a cell-\/tissue-specific context required for tolerance of plants. A complex set of stress-responsive transcription factors is emerging. The imminent availability of genomic DNA sequences and global and cell-specific transcript expression data, combined with determinant identification based on gain- and loss-of-function molecular genetics, will provide the infrastructure for functional physiological dissection of salt tolerance determinants in an organismal context. Furthermore, protein interaction analysis and evaluation of allelism, additivity, and epistasis allow determination of ordered relationships between stress signaling components. Finally, genetic activation and suppression screens will lead inevitably to an understanding of the interrelationships of the multiple signaling systems that control stress-adaptive responses in plants.",

Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water and soil. However, interpreting the > 10,000 wavelength-dependent fluorescence intensity data points represented in EEMs has posed a significant challenge. Fluorescence regional integration, a quantitative technique that integrates the volume beneath an EEM, was developed to analyze EEMs. EEMs were delineated into five excitation-emission regions based on fluorescence of model compounds, DOM fractions, and marine waters or freshwaters. Volumetric integration under the EEM within each region, normalized to the projected excitation-emission area within that region and dissolved organic carbon concentration, resulted in a normalized region-specific EEM volume (phi(i,n)). Solid-state carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, and EEMs were obtained for standard Suwannee River fulvic acid and 15 hydrophobic or hydrophilic acid, neutral, and base DOM fractions plus nonfractionated DOM from wastewater effluents and rivers in the southwestern United States. DOM fractions fluoresced in one or more EEM regions. The highest cumulative EEM volume (phi(T,n) = sigma phi(i,n)) was observed for hydrophobic neutral DOM fractions, followed by lower phi(T,n) values for hydrophobic acid, base, and hydrophilic acid DOM fractions, respectively. An extracted wastewater biomass DOM sample contained aromatic protein- and humic-like material and was characteristic of bacterial-soluble microbial products. Aromatic carbon and the presence of specific aromatic compounds (as indicated by solid-state 13C NMR and FTIR data) resulted in EEMs that aided in differentiating wastewater effluent DOM from drinking water DOM.",

    "text":"Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment. [1] Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr\u22121 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m\u22122. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m\u22122. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m\u22122. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m\u22122, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (\u22120.50 to +1.08) W m\u22122 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (\u22120.06 W m\u22122 with 90% uncertainty bounds of \u22121.45 to +1.29 W m\u22122). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates.",

Geometrical validation around the C\u03b1 is described, with a new C\u03b2 measure and updated Ramachandran plot. Deviation of the observed C\u03b2 atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure-validation information contained in bond angle distortions. C\u03b2 deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. A new \u03d5,\u03c8 plot using density-dependent smoothing for 81,234 non-Gly, non-Pro, and non-prePro residues with B < 30 from 500 high-resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. One such region is the \u03b3-turn conformation near +75\u00b0,\u221260\u00b0, counted as forbidden by common structure-validation programs; however, it occurs in well-ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the \u03b3-turn H-bond. Favored and allowed \u03d5,\u03c8 regions are also defined for Pro, pre-Pro, and Gly (important because Gly \u03d5,\u03c8 angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). Details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of \u03b1-helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. A proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two-peptide NHs permits donating only a single H-bond. New calculations by Hu et al.

    "text":"THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE AND VEGETATION. As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on >2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P < 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot\/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500\u20131600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1\u20133 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands\/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.",

While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality of remaining phosphate rock is decreasing and production costs are increasing.

    "text":"Empirical potential for hydrocarbons for use in simulating the chemical vapor deposition of diamond films. An empirical many-body potential-energy expression is developed for hydrocarbons that can model intramolecular chemical bonding in a variety of small hydrocarbon molecules as well as graphite and diamond lattices. The potential function is based on Tersoff's covalent-bonding formalism with additional terms that correct for an inherent overbinding of radicals and that include nonlocal effects. Atomization energies for a wide range of hydrocarbon molecules predicted by the potential compare well to experimental values. The potential correctly predicts that the \\ensuremath{\\pi}-bonded chain reconstruction is the most stable reconstruction on the diamond {111} surface, and that hydrogen adsorption on a bulk-terminated surface is more stable than the reconstruction. Predicted energetics for the dimer reconstructed diamond {100} surface as well as hydrogen abstraction and chemisorption of small molecules on the diamond {111} surface are also given. The potential function is short ranged and quickly evaluated so it should be very useful for large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of reacting hydrocarbon molecules.",

While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.",

    "text":"Energy production from biomass (part 1): overview of biomass. The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly necessary, if we are to achieve the changes required to address the impacts of global warming. Biomass is the most common form of renewable energy, widely used in the third world but until recently, less so in the Western world. Latterly much attention has been focused on identifying suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs, to replace conventional fossil fuel energy sources. The type of biomass required is largely determined by the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. In the first of three papers, the background to biomass production (in a European climate) and plant properties is examined. In the second paper, energy conversion technologies are reviewed, with emphasis on the production of a gaseous fuel to supplement the gas derived from the landfilling of organic wastes (landfill gas) and used in gas engines to generate electricity. The potential of a restored landfill site to act as a biomass source, providing fuel to supplement landfill gas-fuelled power stations, is examined, together with a comparison of the economics of power production from purpose-grown biomass versus waste-biomass. The third paper considers particular gasification technologies and their potential for biomass gasification.",

    "text":"Changes in the global value of ecosystem services. In 1997, the global value of ecosystem services was estimated to average $33 trillion\/yr in 1995 $US ($46 trillion\/yr in 2007 $US). In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125 trillion\/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145 trillion\/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at $4.3\u201320.2 trillion\/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account.",

    "text":"Isolation and Characterization of Exosomes from Cell Culture Supernatants and Biological Fluids. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles found in cell culture supernatants and in different biological fluids. Exosomes form in a particular population of endosomes, called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), by inward budding into the lumen of the compartment. Upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane, these internal vesicles are secreted. Exosomes possess a defined set of membrane and cytosolic proteins. The physiological function of exosomes is still a matter of debate, but increasing results in various experimental systems suggest their involvement in multiple biological processes. Because both cell-culture supernatants and biological fluids contain different types of lipid membranes, it is critical to perform high-quality exosome purification. This unit describes different approaches for exosome purification from various sources, and discusses methods to evaluate the purity and homogeneity of the purified exosome preparations.",

The BBB at the level of brain microvessel endothelium is the major site of blood-CNS exchange. The structure and function of the BBB is summarised, the physical barrier formed by the endothelial tight junctions, and the transport barrier resulting from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms. The roles of associated cells are outlined, especially the endfeet of astrocytic glial cells, and pericytes and microglia. The embryonic development of the BBB, and changes in pathology are described. The BBB is subject to short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology.

Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most important crop plants for seed protein and oil content, and for its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms. We sequenced the 1.1-gigabase genome by a whole-genome shotgun approach and integrated it with physical and high-density genetic maps to create a chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly. We predict 46,430 protein-coding genes, 70% more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78% of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties.",

RNA and DNA expression vectors containing genes for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, and beta-galactosidase were separately injected into mouse skeletal muscle in vivo. Protein expression was readily detected in all cases, and no special delivery system was required for these effects. The extent of expression from both the RNA and DNA constructs was comparable to that obtained from fibroblasts transfected in vitro under optimal conditions. In situ cytochemical staining for beta-galactosidase activity was localized to muscle cells following injection of the beta-galactosidase DNA vector. After injection of the DNA luciferase expression vector, luciferase activity was present in the muscle for at least 2 months.",

    "text":"Recent advances in semiconductors for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting under irradiation by sunlight has received much attention for production of renewable hydrogen from water on a large scale. Many challenges still remain in improving energy conversion efficiency, such as utilizing longer-wavelength photons for hydrogen production, enhancing the reaction efficiency at any given wavelength, and increasing the lifetime of the semiconductor materials. This introductory review covers the fundamental aspects of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Controlling the semiconducting properties of photocatalysts and photoelectrode materials is the primary concern in developing materials for solar water splitting, because they determine how much photoexcitation occurs in a semiconductor under solar illumination and how many photoexcited carriers reach the surface where water splitting takes place. Given a specific semiconductor material, surface modifications are important not only to activate the semiconductor for water splitting but also to facilitate charge separation and to upgrade the stability of the material under photoexcitation. In addition, reducing resistance loss and forming p-n junction have a significant impact on the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting. Correct evaluation of the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting is becoming more important in enabling an accurate comparison of a number of studies based on different systems. In the latter part, recent advances in the water splitting reaction under visible light will be presented with a focus on non-oxide semiconductor materials to give an overview of the various problems and solutions.",

    "text":"The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism. Tumorigenesis is dependent on the reprogramming of cellular metabolism as both direct and indirect consequence of oncogenic mutations. A common feature of cancer cell metabolism is the ability to acquire necessary nutrients from a frequently nutrient-poor environment and utilize these nutrients to both maintain viability and build new biomass. The alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition, (3) use of glycolysis\/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment. Tumorigenesis is dependent on the reprogramming of cellular metabolism as both direct and indirect consequence of oncogenic mutations. A common feature of cancer cell metabolism is the ability to acquire necessary nutrients from a frequently nutrient-poor environment and utilize these nutrients to both maintain viability and build new biomass.

While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment. While the first observations on metabolic alterations that are characteristic for tumors were first made nearly a century ago, the field of cancer metabolism has become a topic of a renewed interest in the past decade. Aided by new biochemical and molecular biological tools, studies in cancer cell metabolism have expanded our understanding of the mechanisms and functional consequences of tumor-associated metabolic alterations at various stages of tumorigenesis. In particular, it has become evident that tumorigenesis-associated metabolic alterations encompass all stages of cell-metabolite interaction, (1) affecting the metabolite influx through conferring an increased ability to acquire the necessary nutrients, (2) shaping the way the nutrients are preferentially assigned to metabolic pathways that contribute to cellular tumorigenic properties, and (3) exerting long-ranging effects on cellular fate, among which are alterations in differentiation of cancer cells themselves as well as of the components of the tumor microenvironment (Figure 1). In this Perspective, we take a detailed look at distinct hallmarks of tumorigenesis-associated metabolic reprogramming, and examine the functional contribution of these hallmarks to the establishment and maintenance of the tumorigenic state. In order to fulfill the biosynthetic demands associated with proliferation, a cell must increase the import of nutrients from the environment. Two principal nutrients that support survival and biosynthesis in mammalian cells are glucose and glutamine. Through the catabolism of glucose and glutamine, a cell maintains pools of diverse carbon intermediates, which are utilized as building blocks for the assembly of various macromolecules. In addition, controlled oxidation of carbon skeletons of glucose and glutamine allows a cell to capture their reducing power either in the form of NADH and FADH2, which mediate the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain to fuel ATP generation, or in the form of a related cofactor NADPH, which provides reducing power for a wide variety of biosynthetic reactions, as well as helps maintain cellular redox capacity. A markedly increased consumption of glucose by tumors in comparison to the nonproliferating normal tissues was first described more than 90 years ago by the German physiologist Otto Warburg (Warburg and Negelein, 1924Warburg O.P.K. Negelein E. \u00dcber den Stoffwechsel der Carcinomzelle.Biochem Zeitschr. 1924; 152: 309-344Google Scholar, Warburg et al., 1927Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. The metabolism of tumors in the body.J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed in a variety of tumor contexts and shown to correlate with poor tumor prognosis (Som et al., 1980Som P. Atkins H.L. Bandoypadhyay D. Fowler J.S. MacGregor R.R. Matsui K. Oster Z.H. Sacker D.F. Shiue C.Y. Turner H. et al.A fluorinated glucose analog, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18): nontoxic tracer for rapid tumor detection.J. Nucl. Med. 1980; 21: 670-675PubMed Google Scholar). Positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging of the uptake of a radioactive fluorine-labeled glucose analog, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has been successfully used in the clinic for tumor diagnosis and staging, as well as for monitoring responsiveness to treatment (Almuhaideb et al., 2011Almuhaideb A. Papathanasiou N. Bomanji J. 18F-FDG PET\/CT imaging in oncology.Ann. Saudi Med. 2011; 31: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glutamine, a second principal growth-supporting substrate contributes not only carbon but also reduced nitrogen for the de novo biosynthesis of a number of diverse nitrogen-containing compounds. Thus, glutamine provides the nitrogen required for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and nonessential amino acids. Glutamine also has been reported to play a role in the uptake of essential amino acids. While nonessential amino acids can be produced by mammalian cells de novo, essential amino acids must be acquired from external sources. Interestingly, the import of an essential amino acid leucine through the plasma membrane-localized neutral amino acid antiporter LAT1 was shown to be coupled to a simultaneous efflux of glutamine (Nicklin et al., 2009Nicklin P. Bergman P. Zhang B. Triantafellow E. Wang H. Nyfeler B. Yang H. Hild M. Kung C. Wilson C. et al.Bidirectional transport of amino acids regulates mTOR and autophagy.Cell. 2009; 136: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In such a manner, intracellular glutamine may facilitate the import of a broad range of LAT1 substrates, including leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine (Yanagida et al., 2001Yanagida O. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Segawa H. Nii T. Cha S.H. Matsuo H. Fukushima J. Fukasawa Y. et al.Human L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1): characterization of function and expression in tumor cell lines.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The high demand of proliferating tumor cells for glutamine was first described in the 1950s by the American physiologist Harry Eagle, who demonstrated that the optimal growth of cultured HeLa cells requires a 10- to 100-fold molar excess of glutamine in culture medium relative to other amino acids (Eagle, 1955Eagle H. The minimum vitamin requirements of the L and HeLa cells in tissue culture, the production of specific vitamin deficiencies, and their cure.J. Exp. Med. 1955; 102: 595-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, glutamine was found to be the most rapidly consumed amino acid by Ehrlich ascites carcinomas as well as by a number of hepatomas and carcinosarcomas proliferating in vivo (M\u00e1rquez et al., 1989M\u00e1rquez J.

Amino acid, glucose, and lactic acid utilization in vivo by rat tumors.Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4090-4097PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, numerous tumorigenic contexts are associated with the depletion of glutamine from the tumor environment as compared to the corresponding normal tissue (M\u00e1rquez et al., 1989M\u00e1rquez J.

Following the success of the 18F -FDG imaging paradigm, 18F-labeled glutamine tracers have recently shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies (Lieberman et al., 2011Lieberman B.P. Ploessl K. Wang L. Qu W. Zha Z. Wise D.R. Chodosh L.A. Belka G. Thompson C.B. Kung H.F. PET imaging of glutaminolysis in tumors by 18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine.J. Nucl.

Ploessl K. et al.Glutamine-based PET imaging facilitates enhanced metabolic evaluation of gliomas in vivo.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 274ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Use of 18F-labeled glutamine as a tracer appears to provide potentially useful tumor information where the use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is not feasible\u2014for instance, in imaging of tumors that are localized to sites of heavy glucose utilization, such as the brain. What causes tumor cells to internalize high quantities of glucose and glutamine? Normally, despite being surrounded by nutrient-rich plasma and the extracellular fluid, metazoan cells do not import nutrients in a constitutive manner. On the contrary, nutrient uptake is strictly regulated by growth factor signaling (Thompson, 2011Thompson C.B. Rethinking the regulation of cellular metabolism.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2011; 76: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). For instance, when deprived of growth factors, hematopoietic and neuronal cells fail to consume glucose in quantities sufficient to even maintain cellular bioenergetics (Lindsten et al., 2003Lindsten T. Golden J.A. Zong W.X. Minarcik J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. The proapoptotic activities of Bax and Bak limit the size of the neural stem cell pool.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11112-11119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Rathmell et al., 2000Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. In the absence of extrinsic signals, nutrient utilization by lymphocytes is insufficient to maintain either cell size or viability.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, in turn, negatively affects cell size, mitochondrial potential and ATP generation\u2014all despite the abundance of glucose in the culture medium (Rathmell et al., 2000Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. In the absence of extrinsic signals, nutrient utilization by lymphocytes is insufficient to maintain either cell size or viability.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, survival of growth-factor-deprived cells can be readily restored by a combined expression of a plasma membrane glucose transporter GLUT1 and the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway hexokinase (HK) (Rathmell et al., 2003Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Akt-directed glucose metabolism can prevent Bax conformation change and promote growth factor-independent survival.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition to soluble growth factors, interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix play a role in regulating glucose uptake. Culturing mammary epithelial cells under conditions where the cells are detached from the extracellular matrix compromises glucose uptake and results in a depressed mitochondrial potential and decreased ATP levels (Grassian et al., 2011Grassian A.R. Coloff J.L. Brugge J.S. Extracellular matrix regulation of metabolism and implications for tumorigenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2011; 76: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Schafer et al., 2009Schafer Z.T. Grassian A.R. Song L. Jiang Z. Gerhart-Hines Z. Irie H.Y. Gao S. Puigserver P. Brugge J.S. Antioxidant and oncogene rescue of metabolic defects caused by loss of matrix attachment.Nature. 2009; 461: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the influx of glucose into cells is not driven by the immediate bioenergetic needs of a cell but, on the contrary, is rationed strictly as a result of extracellular stimuli. In contrast to their normal counterparts, which require adhesion- and growth-factor-driven signaling inputs to maintain survival and proliferation, cancer cells accumulate oncogenic alterations that convey to them a significant degree of independence from these external requirements (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14940) Google Scholar, Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2004Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer genes and the pathways they control.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). In particular, genetic alterations that target PI-3 kinase, its negative regulators PTEN and INPP4B, and activating mutations and gene amplifications in a variety of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases result in constitutive glucose uptake and metabolism in diverse cancer types. A point of convergence of signals from receptor tyrosine kinases as well as from the extracellular matrix, PI3K\/Akt signaling acts as a master regulator of glucose uptake. PI3K\/Akt signaling promotes both the expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 mRNA and the translocation of GLUT1 protein from the endomembranes to the cell surface (Barthel et al., 1999Barthel A. Okino S.T. Liao J. Nakatani K. Li J. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Roth R.A. Regulation of GLUT1 gene transcription by the serine\/threonine kinase Akt1.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20281-20286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Wieman et al., 2007Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Rathmell J.C. Cytokine stimulation promotes glucose uptake via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase\/Akt regulation of Glut1 activity and trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, Akt potentiates the activity of the HK, which phosphorylates glucose molecules, thus preventing their efflux back into the extracellular space, as well as of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme, which catalyzes the key irreversible step of glycolysis (Deprez et al., 1997Deprez J. Vertommen D. Alessi D.R. Hue L. Rider M.H. Phosphorylation and activation of heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase by protein kinase B and other protein kinases of the insulin signaling cascades.J. Biol.

Inhibition of early apoptotic events by Akt\/PKB is dependent on the first committed step of glycolysis and mitochondrial hexokinase.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In fact, the 18F-FDG-PET signal intensity in tumors correlates closely with the level of PI3K\/Akt pathway activity, and is attenuated by PI-3 kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Benz et al., 2011Benz M.R. Herrmann K. Walter F. Garon E.B. Reckamp K.L. Figlin R. Phelps M.E. Weber W.A. Czernin J. Allen-Auerbach M.S.

Oncol. 2009; 27: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous expression of a constitutively active form of Akt alone can stimulate glycolysis and is sufficient to restore cell size, viability, mitochondrial potential, and ATP levels in growth-factor-deprived cells in a manner that is dependent upon the presence of glucose in the culture medium (Plas et al., 2001Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Akt and Bcl-xL promote growth factor-independent survival through distinct effects on mitochondrial physiology.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Rathmell et al., 2003Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Akt-directed glucose metabolism can prevent Bax conformation change and promote growth factor-independent survival.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The constitutively active form of Akt also prevents a decrease in ATP levels triggered by the loss of cellular attachment (Schafer et al., 2009Schafer Z.T. Grassian A.R. Song L. Jiang Z. Gerhart-Hines Z. Irie H.Y. Gao S. Puigserver P. Brugge J.S. Antioxidant and oncogene rescue of metabolic defects caused by loss of matrix attachment.Nature. 2009; 461: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, Akt signaling is central to facilitating glucose uptake in physiological settings of increased biosynthetic demand. For instance, targeted deletion of Akt1 in the mouse mammary gland abrogates a lactation-induced increase in glucose uptake, resulting in insufficient milk production (Boxer et al., 2006Boxer R.B. Stairs D.B. Dugan K.D. Notarfrancesco K.L. Portocarrero C.P. Keister B.A. Belka G.K. Cho H. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. et al.Isoform-specific requirement for Akt1 in the developmental regulation of cellular metabolism during lactation.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 475-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the PI3K\/Akt signaling module is not the only oncogenic stimulus that plays a role in facilitating glucose uptake. Other oncogenic signaling proteins\u2014notably, Ras\u2014have been found to upregulate GLUT1 mRNA expression and increase cellular glucose consumption (Murakami et al., 1992Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. Identification of two enhancer elements in the gene encoding the type 1 glucose transporter from the mouse which are responsive to serum, growth factor, and oncogenes.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, multiple growth signaling nodes that become aberrantly activated in cancer share an ability to facilitate cellular access to glucose, a principal metabolic substrate. The signaling pathways that regulate glutamine uptake are still being elucidated. The transcription factor c-myc, which is upregulated in proliferating cells and is frequently targeted by amplification in various tumor types, is a principal driver of glutamine utilization by proliferating cells (Wang et al., 2011bWang R. Dillon C.P. Shi L.Z. Milasta S. Carter R. Finkelstein D. McCormick L.L. Fitzgerald P. Chi H. Munger J. Green D.R. The transcription factor Myc controls metabolic reprogramming upon T lymphocyte activation.Immunity. 2011; 35: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Wise et al., 2008Wise D.R. DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. McMahon S.B. Thompson C.B. Myc regulates a transcriptional program that stimulates mitochondrial glutaminolysis and leads to glutamine addiction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18782-18787Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To this end, c-myc induces the transcription of glutamine transporters ASCT2 and SN2, and in addition promotes expression of glutamine-utilizing enzymes glutaminase (GLS1), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS2), and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CAD), which support transporter-facilitated glutamine uptake by converting glutamine to glutamate (Eberhardy and Farnham, 2001Eberhardy S.R.

Nikiforov M.A. Direct role of nucleotide metabolism in C-MYC-dependent proliferation of melanoma cells.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting glutamate cannot exit the cell through glutamine transport, and as it accumulates, promotes TCA cycle anaplerosis and stimulates uptake of cysteine by acting as an exchange substrate for the cysteine antiporter, xCT (Conrad and Sato, 2012Conrad M. Sato H. The oxidative stress-inducible cystine\/glutamate antiporter, system x (c) (-): cystine supplier and beyond.Amino Acids. 2012; 42: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to a positive regulatory input from c-myc, glutamine uptake is also subject to negative regulation by the Rb tumor suppressor family of proteins. The deletion of Rb family proteins has been shown to upregulate the uptake and utilization of glutamine via the E2F-dependent upregulation of ASCT2 and GLS1 (Reynolds et al., 2014Reynolds M.R. Lane A.N. Robertson B. Kemp S. Liu Y. Hill B.G. Dean D.C. Clem B.F. Control of glutamine metabolism by the tumor suppressor Rb.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together, c-myc and E2F, two critical facilitators of cell division, exert their effects, in part, via enabling the access of cells to glutamine\u2014a metabolic substrate critical for the biosynthetic demands that accompany DNA replication. For any given cell, an attempt to proliferate in the absence of proper metabolic resources could end in a disaster. To avoid this, aberrantly activated oncogenes and\/or loss of tumor suppressors lock cancer cells in a state where they constitutively scavenge available glucose, glutamine, and essential amino acids from the extracellular environment, which, in turn, enables their uncontrolled proliferation. Despite the avidity with which they take up glucose and amino acids, cancer cells in vivo often encounter conditions of nutrient scarcity as a result of the increased rates of nutrient consumption and the inadequacies of the tumor vascular supply (Vaupel et al., 1989Vaupel P. Kallinowski F. Okunieff P. Blood flow, oxygen and nutrient supply, and metabolic microenvironment of human tumors: a review.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6449-6465PubMed Google Scholar). To deal with depleted supplies of the normal anabolic precursors, certain cancers acquire mutations that activate the cellular ability to utilize alternative ways of obtaining necessary nutrients. For instance, plasma and interstitial fluid of tissues are rich in soluble protein, yet extracellular protein is not generally utilized as a source of amino acids. Remarkably, expression of mutant Ras or c-Src alleles provides cells with a mechanism that allows them to recover free amino acids through the lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins (Commisso et al., 2013Commisso C. Davidson S.M. Soydaner-Azeloglu R.G. Parker S.J. Kamphorst J.J. Hackett S. Grabocka E. Nofal M. Drebin J.A. Thompson C.B. et al.Macropinocytosis of protein is an amino acid supply route in Ras-transformed cells.Nature. 2013; 497: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). In contrast to the uptake of low-molecular-weight nutrients, which enter the cell through dedicated transporters, capture of extracellular macromolecules occurs through macropinocytosis, a process in which bulk extracellular fluid is taken up into giant vesicles (Kerr and Teasdale, 2009Kerr M.C. Teasdale R.D. Defining macropinocytosis.Traffic. 2009; 10: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Macropinocytosis is stimulated by Ras- and c-Src-driven actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Fluid-filled macropinosomes are trafficked into the interior of the cell, where they fuse with lysosomes and the engulfed proteins are subjected to proteolytic degradation, liberating free amino acids. Indeed, supplementation of culture medium with physiological levels (20\u201330 mg\/mL) of serum albumin enables proliferation of KRASG12D-transformed MEFs in the absence of an essential amino acid leucine (Palm et al., 2015Palm W. Park Y. Wright K. Pavlova N.N. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. The utilization of extracellular proteins as nutrients is suppressed by mTORC1.Cell. 2015; 162: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Albumin supplementation has even been shown to restore the proliferation of a KRASG12D-driven mouse pancreatic cancer line in the culture medium that was devoid of all free amino acids (Kamphorst et al., 2015Kamphorst J.J. Nofal M. Commisso C. Hackett S.R. Lu W. Grabocka E. Vander Heiden M.G. Miller G. Drebin J.A. Bar-Sagi D. et al.Human pancreatic cancer tumors are nutrient poor and tumor cells actively scavenge extracellular protein.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 544-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect of KRASG12D, PI3K\/Akt signaling does not promote cellular utilization of extracellular protein, despite the ability of this pathway to stimulate the uptake of low-molecular-weight nutrients (Palm et al., 2015Palm W. Park Y. Wright K. Pavlova N.N. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. The utilization of extracellular proteins as nutrients is suppressed by mTORC1.Cell. 2015; 162: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, mTORC1 inhibitors greatly increase the cellular ability to recover amino acids from captured extracellular protein and enhance their growth in the absence of essential amino acids (Palm et al., 2015Palm W. Park Y. Wright K. Pavlova N.N. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. The utilization of extracellular proteins as nutrients is suppressed by mTORC1.Cell. 2015; 162: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the utilization of extracellular protein as nutrients is repressed by mTORC1 under amino-acid-replete conditions and is only utilized as an emergency source in conditions when free amino acids are insufficient. A spatial difference in the effect of rapamycin treatment in a KRASG12D-driven mouse model of pancreatic cancer provides a striking illustration of this paradigm. While rapamycin suppresses cancer cell proliferation at the tumor margin where the vascular delivery of nutrients is effective, rapamycin enhances cell proliferation within the poorly vascularized tumor core by promoting enhanced lysosomal degradation of extracellular proteins (Palm et al., 2015Palm W. Park Y. Wright K. Pavlova N.N. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. The utilization of extracellular proteins as nutrients is suppressed by mTORC1.Cell. 2015; 162: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to soluble extracellular proteins, free amino acids can be recovered from the engulfment and digestion of entire living cells via a process known as entosis (Figure 3B), as well as from phagocytosis of apoptotic cellular corpses (Figure 3C) (Krajcovic et al., 2013Krajcovic M. Krishna S. Akkari L. Joyce J.A. Overholtzer M. mTOR regulates phagosome and entotic vacuole fission.Mol. Biol.

    "text":"The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20% (grassland and savannah) to 80% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.",

    "text":"Landscape perspectives on agricultural intensification and biodiversity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ecosystem service management. Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.",

Hydrogel products constitute a group of polymeric materials, the hydrophilic structure of which renders them capable of holding large amounts of water in their three-dimensional networks. Extensive employment of these products in a number of industrial and environmental areas of application is considered to be of prime importance. As expected, natural hydrogels were gradually replaced by synthetic types due to their higher water absorption capacity, long service life, and wide varieties of raw chemical resources. Literature on this subject was found to be expanding, especially in the scientific areas of research. However, a number of publications and technical reports dealing with hydrogel products from the engineering points of view were examined to overview technological aspects covering this growing multidisciplinary field of research. The primary objective of this article is to review the literature concerning classification of hydrogels on different bases, physical and chemical characteristics of these products, and technical feasibility of their utilization. It also involved technologies adopted for hydrogel production together with process design implications, block diagrams, and optimized conditions of the preparation process. An innovated category of recent generations of hydrogel materials was also presented in some details.",

    "text":"Extraterrestrial Cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction. Platinum metals are depleted in the earth's crust relative to their cosmic abundance; concentrations of these elements in deep-sea sediments may thus indicate influxes of extraterrestrial material. Deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand show iridium increases of about 30, 160, and 20 times, respectively, above the background level at precisely the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 65 million years ago. Reasons are given to indicate that this iridium is of extraterrestrial origin, but did not come from a nearby supernova. A hypothesis is suggested which accounts for the extinctions and the iridium observations. Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record. One prediction of this hypothesis has been verified: the chemical composition of the boundary clay, which is thought to come from the stratospheric dust, is markedly different from that of clay mixed with the Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones, which are chemically similar to each other. Four different independent estimates of the diameter of the asteroid give values that lie in the range 10 +\/- 4 kilometers.",

Parent and alkyl PAHs (51 compounds and alkyl homologues) have been quantified in suspended particulates and sediments (345 samples) from the Fraser River system, British Columbia, Canada. The best potential to distinguish natural and anthropogenic sources is exhibited by ratios of the principal mass 178, 202, 228 and 276 parent PAHs, 1,7\/2,6+1,7-DMP (dimethylphenanthrene), the phenanthrene\/anthracene and fluoranthene\/pyrene alkyl PAH series and several less commonly applied PAHs (e.g. acephenanthrylene and pentaphene). Using these ratios we infer sources of PAH to the Fraser basin and evaluate the consistency of these source assignments and the suitability of various commonly applied PAH ratios as indicators. PAH ratios and total concentration data reveal a basin lightly impacted by a variety of sources in its remote regions, especially near roads, but heavily impacted in urban areas, particularly near Vancouver. Contamination sources shift from biomass (e.g. wood and grass) burning to vehicle emissions between remote and urban locations. Stormwater and wastewater discharges appear to collect PAH from urban areas and release them as point sources. In contaminated areas ratios are specific for combustion vs. petroleum sources, and some ratios (202 and 276) distinguish biomass or coal from liquid fossil fuel combustion. At lower concentrations multiple sources at times make interpretations based on a single ratio misleading and the higher mass ratios (228 and 276) may be most applicable to urban areas. In all cases the examination of a variety of PAH indicator ratios that encompass a range of masses is necessary for a robust interpretation.",

A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.",

We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109\/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13\/3 ionization potential database, the EA13\/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38\/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for general-purpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements.

Abstract Using the concept of \u201corbital tuning\u201d, a continuous, high-resolution deep-sea chronostratigraphy has been developed spanning the last 300,000 yr. The chronology is developed using a stacked oxygen-isotope stratigraphy and four different orbital tuning approaches, each of which is based upon a different assumption concerning the response of the orbital signal recorded in the data. Each approach yields a separate chronology. The error measured by the standard deviation about the average of these four results (which represents the \u201cbest\u201d chronology) has an average magnitude of only 2500 yr. This small value indicates that the chronology produced is insensitive to the specific orbital tuning technique used. Excellent convergence between chronologies developed using each of five different paleoclimatological indicators (from a single core) is also obtained. The resultant chronology is also insensitive to the specific indicator used. The error associated with each tuning approach is estimated independently and propagated through to the average result. The resulting error estimate is independent of that associated with the degree of convergence and has an average magnitude of 3500 yr, in excellent agreement with the 2500-yr estimate. Transfer of the final chronology to the stacked record leads to an estimated error of \u00b11500 yr. Thus the final chronology has an average error of \u00b15000 yr.",

The nanoparticle treatment caused cell cycle arrest in G(2)\/M phase possibly due to repair of damaged DNA. Annexin-V propidium iodide (PI) staining showed no massive apoptosis or necrosis. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis indicated the presence of Ag-np inside the mitochondria and nucleus, implicating their direct involvement in the mitochondrial toxicity and DNA damage. A possible mechanism of toxicity is proposed which involves disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by Ag-np leading to production of ROS and interruption of ATP synthesis, which in turn cause DNA damage. It is anticipated that DNA damage is augmented by deposition, followed by interactions of Ag-np to the DNA leading to cell cycle arrest in the G(2)\/M phase. The higher sensitivity of U251 cells and their arrest in G(2)\/M phase could be explored further for evaluating the potential use of Ag-np in cancer therapy.",

FLUXNET is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70\u00b0N to 30\u00b0S. FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community. (Data and site information are available online at the FLUXNET Web site, http:\/\/www-eosdis.ornl.gov\/FLUXNET\/.) Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the regional networks are intercomparable. And third, FLUXNET supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are being generated by sensors mounted on the NASA Terra satellite. Data being compiled by FLUXNET are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere trace gas exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net CO 2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by about 5.7 g C m \u22122 day \u22121 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of CO 2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal temperature of net CO 2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities.",

In general, a reduction in trade barriers will affect the environment by expanding the scale of economic activity, by altering the composition of economic activity and by initiating a change in the techniques of production.

We first use comparable measures of three air pollutants in a cross-section of urban areas located in 42 countries to study the relationship between air quality and economic growth. We find for two pollutants (sulphur dioxide and `smoke') that concentrations increase with per capita GDP at low levels of national income, but decrease with GDP growth at higher levels of income. We then study the determinants of the industry pattern of US imports from Mexico and of value added by Mexico's maquiladora sector. We investigate whether the size of pollution abatement costs in US industry influences the pattern of international trade and investment.

The potential biochar applications include carbon sequestration, soil fertility improvement, pollution remediation, and agricultural by-product\/waste recycling. The key parameters controlling its properties include pyrolysis temperature, residence time, heat transfer rate, and feedstock type. The efficacy of biochar in contaminant management depends on its surface area, pore size distribution and ion-exchange capacity. Physical architecture and molecular composition of biochar could be critical for practical application to soil and water. Relatively high pyrolysis temperatures generally produce biochars that are effective in the sorption of organic contaminants by increasing surface area, microporosity, and hydrophobicity; whereas the biochars obtained at low temperatures are more suitable for removing inorganic\/polar organic contaminants by oxygen-containing functional groups, electrostatic attraction, and precipitation. However, due to complexity of soil-water system in nature, the effectiveness of biochars on remediation of various organic\/inorganic contaminants is still uncertain.

During nutrient deprivation, cellular lipids stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets are hydrolysed into fatty acids for energy. A second cellular response to starvation is the induction of autophagy, which delivers intracellular proteins and organelles sequestered in double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) to lysosomes for degradation and use as an energy source. Lipolysis and autophagy share similarities in regulation and function but are not known to be interrelated. Here we show a previously unknown function for autophagy in regulating intracellular lipid stores (macrolipophagy). Lipid droplets and autophagic components associated during nutrient deprivation, and inhibition of autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver increased triglyceride storage in lipid droplets. This study identifies a critical function for autophagy in lipid metabolism that could have important implications for human diseases with lipid over-accumulation such as those that comprise the metabolic syndrome. Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol. Under conditions of nutrient deprivation, droplet triglycerides are hydrolysed to generate free fatty acids that are oxidized to provide energy. A second cellular response to starvation is autophagy, in which the cell digests its own components to provide nutrients. Singh et al. describe a novel function for autophagy in regulating lipid metabolism, which they term 'macrolipophagy'. In this process, lipid droplets and autophagic components associate during starvation and inhibition of autophagy increases lipid storage in lipid droplets. Autophagy promotes lipid hydrolysis and generation of free fatty acids by releasing the content of lipid droplets to lysosomes for degradation. This work identifies a critical role of autophagy in regulating lipid metabolism and may provide a new approach to the prevention of lipid accumulation in disease.

Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term trait itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the performance paradigm to plant ecology. Functional are defined as morpho-physiophenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing integration functions which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.",

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.",

    "text":"Graphene, related two-dimensional crystals, and hybrid systems for energy conversion and storage. Background The integration of graphene in photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and devices for hydrogen generation offers opportunities to tackle challenges driven by the increasing global energy demand. Graphene\u2019s two-dimensional (2D) nature leads to a theoretical surface-to-mass ratio of ~2600 m 2 \/g, which combined with its high electrical conductivity and flexibility, gives it the potential to store electric charge, ions, or hydrogen. Other 2D crystals, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides, are also promising and are now gaining increasing attention for energy applications. The advantage of using such 2D crystals is linked to the possibility of creating and designing layered artificial structures with \u201con-demand\u201d properties by means of spin-on processes, or layer-by-layer assembly. This approach exploits the availability of materials with metallic, semiconducting, and insulating properties. Advances The success of graphene and related materials (GRMs) for energy applications crucially depends on the development and optimization of production methods. High-volume liquid-phase exfoliation is being developed for a wide variety of layered materials. This technique is being optimized to control the flake size and to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, which is crucial for optimizing electrode performance in fuel cells and batteries. Micro- or nanocrystal or flake edge control can also be achieved through chemical synthesis. This is an ideal route for functionalization, in order to improve storage capacity. Large-area growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated, producing material with high structural and electronic quality for the preparation of transparent conducting electrodes for displays and touch-screens, and is being evaluated for photovoltaic applications. CVD growth of other multicomponent layered materials is less mature and needs further development. Although many transfer techniques have been developed successfully, further improvement of high-volume manufacturing and transfer processes for multilayered heterostructures is needed. In this context, layer-by-layer assembly may enable the realization of devices with on-demand properties for targeted applications, such as photovoltaic devices in which photon absorption in TMDs is combined with charge transport in graphene. Outlook Substantial progress has been made on the preparation of GRMs at the laboratory level. However, cost-effective production of GRMs on an industrial scale is needed to create the future energy value chain. Applications that could benefit the most from GRMs include flexible electronics, batteries with efficient anodes and cathodes, supercapacitors with high energy density, and solar cells. The realization of GRMs with specific transport and insulating properties on demand is an important goal. Additional energy applications of GRMs comprise water splitting and hydrogen production. As an example, the edges of MoS 2 single layers can oxidize fuels\u2014such as hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol\u2014in fuel cells, and GRM membranes can be used in fuel cells to improve proton exchange. Functionalized graphene can be exploited for water splitting and hydrogen production. Flexible and wearable devices and membranes incorporating GRMs can also generate electricity from motion, as well as from water and gas flows. Tailored GRMs for energy applications. The ability to produce GRMs with desired specific properties paves the way to their integration in a variety of energy devices. Solution processing and chemical vapor deposition are the ideal means to produce thin films that can be used as electrodes in energy devices (such as solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, or in hydrogen storage). Chemical synthesis is an attractive route to produce \u201cactive\u201d elements in solar cell or thermoelectric devices.",

Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth\u2019s surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y\u22121 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y\u22121 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.",

In December 2016, a panel of experts in microbiology, nutrition and clinical research was convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics to review the definition and scope of prebiotics. Consistent with the original embodiment of prebiotics, but aware of the latest scientific and clinical developments, the panel updated the definition of a prebiotic: a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. This definition expands the concept of prebiotics to possibly include non-carbohydrate substances, applications to body sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, and diverse categories other than food. The requirement for selective microbiota-mediated mechanisms was retained. Beneficial health effects must be documented for a substance to be considered a prebiotic. The consensus definition applies also to prebiotics for use by animals, in which microbiota-focused strategies to maintain health and prevent disease is as relevant as for humans. Ultimately, the goal of this Consensus Statement is to engender appropriate use of the term 'prebiotic' by relevant stakeholders so that consistency and clarity can be achieved in research reports, product marketing and regulatory oversight of the category.

    "text":"GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASES. \u25aa Abstract This review describes the three mammalian glutathione transferase (GST) families, namely cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal GST, the latter now designated MAPEG. Besides detoxifying electrophilic xenobiotics, such as chemical carcinogens, environmental pollutants, and antitumor agents, these transferases inactivate endogenous \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes, quinones, epoxides, and hydroperoxides formed as secondary metabolites during oxidative stress. These enzymes are also intimately involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, testosterone, and progesterone, as well as the degradation of tyrosine. Among their substrates, GSTs conjugate the signaling molecules 15-deoxy-\u0394 12,14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15d-PGJ 2 ) and 4-hydroxynonenal with glutathione, and consequently they antagonize expression of genes trans-activated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Through metabolism of 15d-PGJ 2 , GST may enhance gene expression driven by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Cytosolic human GST exhibit genetic polymorphisms and this variation can increase susceptibility to carcinogenesis and inflammatory disease. Polymorphisms in human MAPEG are associated with alterations in lung function and increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Targeted disruption of murine genes has demonstrated that cytosolic GST isoenzymes are broadly cytoprotective, whereas MAPEG proteins have proinflammatory activities. Furthermore, knockout of mouse GSTA4 and GSTZ1 leads to overexpression of transferases in the Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes, an observation suggesting they are part of an adaptive mechanism that responds to endogenous chemical cues such as 4-hydroxynonenal and tyrosine degradation products. Consistent with this hypothesis, the promoters of cytosolic GST and MAPEG genes contain antioxidant response elements through which they are transcriptionally activated during exposure to Michael reaction acceptors and oxidative stress.",

Abstract Gene transcripts with invariant abundance during development and in the face of environmental stimuli are essential reference points for accurate gene expression analyses, such as RNA gel-blot analysis or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An exceptionally large set of data from Affymetrix ATH1 whole-genome GeneChip studies provided the means to identify a new generation of reference genes with very stable expression levels in the model plant species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Hundreds of Arabidopsis genes were found that outperform traditional reference genes in terms of expression stability throughout development and under a range of environmental conditions. Most of these were expressed at much lower levels than traditional reference genes, making them very suitable for normalization of gene expression over a wide range of transcript levels. Specific and efficient primers were developed for 22 genes and tested on a diverse set of 20 cDNA samples. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed superior expression stability and lower absolute expression levels for many of these genes, including genes encoding a protein phosphatase 2A subunit, a coatomer subunit, and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The developed PCR primers or hybridization probes for the novel reference genes will enable better normalization and quantification of transcript levels in Arabidopsis in the future.",

Abstract Eleven coupled climate\u2013carbon cycle models used a common protocol to study the coupling between climate change and the carbon cycle. The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850\u20132100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.",

Urban land-cover change threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon storage. However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km 2 , nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr \u22121 ), equal to \u223c5% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.",

A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism.

This paper is a synthesis of the use of selected trace elements as proxies for reconstruction of paleoproductivity and paleoredox conditions. Many of the trace elements considered here show variations in oxidation state and solubility as a function of the redox status of the depositional environment. Redox-sensitive trace metals tend to be more soluble under oxidizing conditions and less soluble under reducing conditions, resulting in authigenic enrichments in oxygen-depleted sedimentary facies. This behavior makes U, V and Mo, and to a lesser extent certain other trace metals such as Cr and Co, useful as paleoredox proxies. Some redox-sensitive elements are delivered to the sediment mainly in association with organic matter (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd) and they may be retained within the sediment in association with pyrite, after organic matter decay in reducing sediment. This particularity confers to Ni and Cu a good value as proxies for organic C sinking flux (frequently referred to as productivity). Elements with only one oxidation state such as Ba and P are classically used to assess paleoproductivity levels but they suffer from the fact that they are solubilized under reducing conditions and may be lost from oxygen-deprived sediments. The combined used of U, V and Mo enrichments may allow suboxic environments to be distinguished from anoxic\u2013euxinic ones. Specifically, these elements tend to be much more strongly enriched in anoxic\u2013euxinic environments and to exhibit weaker covariation with TOC than in suboxic environments.",

    "text":"Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem functioning from plant traits: revisiting the Holy Grail. Summary 1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and\/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced",

    "text":"Environmental, economic, and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels. Negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To be a viable alternative, a biofuel should provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. We use these criteria to evaluate, through life-cycle accounting, ethanol from corn grain and biodiesel from soybeans. Ethanol yields 25% more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas biodiesel yields 93% more. Compared with ethanol, biodiesel releases just 1.0%, 8.3%, and 13% of the agricultural nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants, respectively, per net energy gain. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12% by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41% by biodiesel. Biodiesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. These advantages of biodiesel over ethanol come from lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion of feedstocks to fuel. Neither biofuel can replace much petroleum without impacting food supplies. Even dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to biofuels would meet only 12% of gasoline demand and 6% of diesel demand. Until recent increases in petroleum prices, high production costs made biofuels unprofitable without subsidies. Biodiesel provides sufficient environmental advantages to merit subsidy. Transportation biofuels such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels.",

Abstract Despite the growing body of literature on ecosystem services, still many challenges remain to structurally integrate ecosystem services in landscape planning, management and design. This paper therefore aims to provide an overview of the challenges involved in applying ecosystem service assessment and valuation to environmental management and discuss some solutions to come to a comprehensive and practical framework. First the issue of defining and classifying ecosystem services is discussed followed by approaches to quantify and value ecosystem services. The main part of the paper is focussed on the question how to analyze trade-offs involved in land cover and land use change, including spatial analysis and dynamic modelling tools. Issues of scale are addressed, as well as the question how to determine the total economic value of different management states. Finally, developments and challenges regarding the inclusion of ecosystem services in integrative landscape planning and decision-making tools are discussed. It is concluded that the ecosystem service approach and ecosystem service valuation efforts have changed the terms of discussion on nature conservation, natural resource management, and other areas of public policy. It is now widely recognized that nature conservation and conservation management strategies do not necessarily pose a trade-off between the \u201cenvironment\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d.

Abstract Cancer nanotherapeutics are rapidly progressing and are being implemented to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems such as nonspecific biodistribution and targeting, lack of water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, and low therapeutic indices. To improve the biodistribution of cancer drugs, nanoparticles have been designed for optimal size and surface characteristics to increase their circulation time in the bloodstream. They are also able to carry their loaded active drugs to cancer cells by selectively using the unique pathophysiology of tumors, such as their enhanced permeability and retention effect and the tumor microenvironment. In addition to this passive targeting mechanism, active targeting strategies using ligands or antibodies directed against selected tumor targets amplify the specificity of these therapeutic nanoparticles. Drug resistance, another obstacle that impedes the efficacy of both molecularly targeted and conventional chemotherapeutic agents, might also be overcome, or at least reduced, using nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have the ability to accumulate in cells without being recognized by P-glycoprotein, one of the main mediators of multidrug resistance, resulting in the increased intracellular concentration of drugs. Multifunctional and multiplex nanoparticles are now being actively investigated and are on the horizon as the next generation of nanoparticles, facilitating personalized and tailored cancer treatment.",

    "text":"Metabolic Reprogramming: A Cancer Hallmark Even Warburg Did Not Anticipate. Cancer metabolism has long been equated with aerobic glycolysis, seen by early biochemists as primitive and inefficient. Despite these early beliefs, the metabolic signatures of cancer cells are not passive responses to damaged mitochondria but result from oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming required to support anabolic growth. Recent evidence suggests that metabolites themselves can be oncogenic by altering cell signaling and blocking cellular differentiation. No longer can cancer-associated alterations in metabolism be viewed as an indirect response to cell proliferation and survival signals. We contend that altered metabolism has attained the status of a core hallmark of cancer. Cancer metabolism has long been equated with aerobic glycolysis, seen by early biochemists as primitive and inefficient. Despite these early beliefs, the metabolic signatures of cancer cells are not passive responses to damaged mitochondria but result from oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming required to support anabolic growth. Recent evidence suggests that metabolites themselves can be oncogenic by altering cell signaling and blocking cellular differentiation. No longer can cancer-associated alterations in metabolism be viewed as an indirect response to cell proliferation and survival signals. We contend that altered metabolism has attained the status of a core hallmark of cancer. The propensity for proliferating cells to secrete a significant fraction of glucose carbon through fermentation was first elucidated in yeast. Otto Warburg extended these observations to mammalian cells, finding that proliferating ascites tumor cells converted the majority of their glucose carbon to lactate, even in oxygen-rich conditions. Warburg hypothesized that this altered metabolism was specific to cancer cells, and that it arose from mitochondrial defects that inhibited their ability to effectively oxidize glucose carbon to CO2. An extension of this hypothesis was that dysfunctional mitochondria caused cancer (Koppenol et al., 2011Koppenol W.H. Bounds P.L. Dang C.V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Warburg's seminal finding has been observed in a wide variety of cancers. These observations have been exploited clinically using 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). However, in contrast to Warburg's original hypothesis, damaged mitochondria are not at the root of the aerobic glycolysis exhibited by most tumor cells. Most tumor mitochondria are not defective in their ability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, in proliferating cells, mitochondrial metabolism is reprogrammed to meet the challenges of macromolecular synthesis. This possibility was never considered by Warburg and his contemporaries. Advances in cancer metabolism research over the last decade have enhanced our understanding of how aerobic glycolysis and other metabolic alterations observed in cancer cells support the anabolic requirements associated with cell growth and proliferation. It has become clear that anabolic metabolism is under complex regulatory control directed by growth-factor signal transduction in nontransformed cells. Yet despite these advances, the repeated refrain from traditional biochemists is that altered metabolism is merely an indirect phenomenon in cancer, a secondary effect that pales in importance to the activation of primary proliferation and survival signals (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). Most proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes encode components of signal transduction pathways. Their roles in carcinogenesis have traditionally been attributed to their ability to regulate the cell cycle and sustain proliferative signaling while also helping cells evade growth suppression and\/or cell death (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). But evidence for an alternative concept, that the primary functions of activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressors are to reprogram cellular metabolism, has continued to build over the past several years. Evidence is also developing for the proposal that proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors primarily evolved to regulate metabolism. We begin this review by discussing how proliferative cell metabolism differs from quiescent cell metabolism on the basis of active metabolic reprogramming by proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Much of this reprogramming depends on utilizing mitochondria as functional biosynthetic organelles. We then further develop the idea that altered metabolism is a primary feature selected for during tumorigenesis. Recent advances have demonstrated that altered metabolism in cancer extends beyond adaptations to meet the increased anabolic requirements of a growing and dividing cell. Changes in cancer cell metabolism can also influence cellular differentiation status, and in some cases these changes arise from oncogenic alterations in metabolic enzymes themselves. Most nonproliferating, differentiated cells depend on the efficiency of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation to maintain their integrity. As a result, such cells metabolize glucose to pyruvate through glycolysis, and then completely oxidize most of this pyruvate to CO2 through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of the mitochondria, where oxygen is the final acceptor in an electron transport chain that generates an electrochemical gradient facilitating ATP production. The elucidation of the TCA cycle and how cells maximize ATP production to maintain themselves was one of the great discoveries of the last century. In vivo, metazoan cells are surrounded by an abundance of nutrients. However, unlike prokaryotes or single-cell eukaryotes, animal cells are not cell autonomous for nutrient uptake. Instead, just to survive, metazoan cells compete for limiting levels of growth factors that direct nutrient uptake (Rathmell et al., 2000Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To survive under such conditions, differentiated cells adopt a catabolic metabolism focused on maximizing the efficiency of ATP production from limited nutrients (Deberardinis et al., 2006Deberardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37372-37380Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B.

Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). In contrast, when growth factors are abundant, cells increase their nutrient uptake and adopt an anabolic metabolism (Bauer et al., 2004Bauer D.E. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Lum J.J. Hammerman P.S. Rathmell J.C. Riley J.L. Thompson C.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). As a consequence of intracellular abundance of nutrients, growth-factor-stimulated cells adapt to their largesse by initiating cell division in a manner analogous to that of single-cell eukaryotes exposed to nutrient-rich medium (Boer et al., 2010Boer V.M. Crutchfield C.A. Bradley P.H. Botstein D. Rabinowitz J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Conlon and Raff, 2003Conlon I. Raff M. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fantes and Nurse, 1977Fantes P. Nurse P. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 107: 377-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cancer cells, the instructional signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors can be constitutively activated in the absence of extracellular growth factors. The traditional cancer model posits that the altered metabolism associated with cell proliferation occurs as a secondary response to cell cycle and proliferative signaling. In this model, the demand for free energy to sustain transcription and translation drives a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, leading to subsequent allosteric effects on rate-limiting metabolic enzymes (Figure 2A ). While traditional allosteric regulation certainly occurs in proliferating cells, strong evidence now exists to support an alternative model. In this supply-based model, changes in metabolic fluxes occur in primary response to growth-factor signaling, independent of changes in ATP and other mechanisms worked out by early biochemists (Figure 2B). The reprogramming of cellular metabolism toward macromolecular synthesis is critical to supplying enough nucleotides, proteins, and lipids for a cell to double its total biomass and then divide to produce two daughter cells. In contrast to the catabolic metabolism of differentiated cells, this anabolic metabolism fundamental to cell growth and proliferation is not focused on maximizing ATP yield. Rather than ATP, proliferating cells are in much greater need of reduced carbon and reduced nitrogen, as well as cytosolic NADPH for reductive biosynthetic reactions. The recognition that proliferating cells do not maximize ATP production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has contributed to the continuing misconception that proliferating cells, particularly cancer cells, do not utilize mitochondria. In fact, most cancer cells and proliferating normal cells still derive a significant fraction of their ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. However, in proliferating cells, in contrast to quiescent cells, this oxidative phosphorylation-dependent production of ATP appears secondary to the use of mitochondrial enzymes in the synthesis of anabolic precursors. Activation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway is perhaps the most common lesion in spontaneous human cancers. Activated PI3K\/Akt leads to enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis (Buzzai et al., 2005Buzzai M. Bauer D.E. Jones R.G. Deberardinis R.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Elstrom R.L. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Elstrom et al., 2004Elstrom R.L.

Pivotal to this induction is increased glucose transporter expression on the cell surface, activation of hexokinase to capture glucose intracellularly through phosphorylation, and Akt-induced, phosphofructokinase-2-dependent allosteric activation of phosphofructokinase-1 to commit glucose to glycolytic metabolism (Deprez et al., 1997Deprez J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, the PI3K\/Akt pathway also promotes glucose carbon flux into biosynthetic pathways that rely upon functional mitochondrial metabolism (Figure 3). For example, fatty acid, cholesterol, and isoprenoid synthesis all require acetyl-CoA (Wakil et al., 1957Wakil S.J. Porter J.W. Gibson D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 453-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts glucose-derived pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is solely mitochondrial (Linn et al., 1969Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1969; 62: 234-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA then cannot be directly exported to the cytoplasm but instead must first condense with oxaloacetate to form citrate through the activity of another exclusively mitochondrial enzyme, citrate synthase (Stern et al., 1952Stern J.R. Ochoa S. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 313-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Citrate can then be exported to the cytosol, where it can be converted back to acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) (Srere, 1959Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2544-2547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt facilitates this diversion of mitochondrial citrate from the TCA cycle to acetyl-CoA production by phosphorylating and activating ACL (Bauer et al., 2005Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Berwick et al., 2002Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol.

Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). RNAi knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of ACL is particularly effective at decreasing the in vitro proliferation of cells with increased glucose uptake. ACL knockdown can also diminish Akt-driven tumorigenesis in vivo (Bauer et al., 2005Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Hatzivassiliou et al., 2005Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). ACL's breakdown of citrate is also pivotal to preventing a cytosolic accumulation of citrate. Citrate is a major negative allosteric regulator of glycolysis (Stryer, 1995Stryer L. Biochemistry.Fourth Edition. W.H. Feeman and Company, New York1995Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the reprogramming of mitochondrial citrate metabolism is a central aspect of PI3K\/Akt oncogenic activity. Downstream of PI3K\/Akt, the well-characterized cell growth regulator mTORC1 also has many effects intertwined with mitochondrial metabolism. mTORC1 is best known for enhancing protein synthesis. Several amino acid precursors are derived from the transamination of mitochondrial intermediates. Oxaloacetate can be transaminated to produce aspartate which can serve as a precursor for asparagine, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate can be transaminated to produce glutamate, which in turn can be converted to proline, arginine, and glutamine. Most cancers depend on these syntheses rather than exogenous supplies. This is consistent with how most tumors other than childhood leukemia are resistant to the effects of depleting the blood of asparagine through the intravenous use of L-asparaginase (Clarkson et al., 1970Clarkson B. Krakoff I. Burchenal J. Karnofsky D. Golbey R. Dowling M. Oettgen H. Lipton A. Cancer. 1970; 25: 279-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tallal et al., 1970Tallal L. Tan C. Oettgen H. Wollner N. McCarthy M. Helson L. Burchenal J. Karnofsky D. Murphy M.L. Cancer. 1970; 25: 306-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mTORC1 has also been shown to have direct effects on promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, in part via a transcriptional complex that promotes the function of PGC-1\u03b1 (Bentzinger et al., 2008Bentzinger C.F. Romanino K. Clo\u00ebtta D. Lin S. Mascarenhas J.B. Oliveri F. Xia J. Casanova E. Costa C.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Finally, a study isolating the cell-intrinsic consequences of mTORC1 activation demonstrated that SREBP-mediated de novo lipogenesis is a critical component of mTORC1-driven proliferation (D\u00fcvel et al., 2010D\u00fcvel K. Yecies J.L. Menon S. Raman P. Lipovsky A.I. Souza A.L. Triantafellow E. Ma Q. Gorski R. Cleaver S. et al.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As discussed above, de novo lipogenesis in mammalian cells depends on mitochondrial citrate production. Notably, D\u00fcvel et al., 2010D\u00fcvel K. Yecies J.L. Menon S. Raman P. Lipovsky A.I. Souza A.L. Triantafellow E. Ma Q. Gorski R. Cleaver S. et al.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar found that the other major target of mTORC1 activation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), is not critical for mTORC1-driven proliferation. This may seem surprising in light of HIF-1's often-cited ability to promote the enhanced glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells. However, HIF-1 activation has the additional effect of inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism of glucose carbon, in part by promoting the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) to inhibit PDH activity (Kim et al., 2006Kim J.W.

By diverting pyruvate into lactate, HIF-1 blocks glucose carbon incorporation into mitochondrial citrate which is critical for lipid synthesis (Lum et al., 2007Lum J.J. Bui T. Gruber M. Gordan J.D.

This block correlates with the antiproliferative effect of HIF-1 observed in hematopoietic and renal cells (Lum et al., 2007Lum J.J. Bui T. Gruber M. Gordan J.D. DeBerardinis R.J. Covello K.L. Simon M.C. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and fits with recent genetic evidence of HIF-1 acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers (Shen et al., 2011Shen C.

There are cancers that do exhibit decreased flux of glucose-derived pyruvate into the mitochondria relative to normal tissues. However, as will be discussed later in this review, these cancers still rely on mitochondrial metabolic flux. In place of oxidative metabolism of both glucose and glutamine, these cancers preferentially perform reductive and carboxylating biosynthetic reactions from glutamine carbon (Le et al., 2012Le A. Lane A.N. Hamaker M. Bose S. Gouw A. Barbi J. Tsukamoto T. Rojas C.J. Slusher B.S.

Like PI3K, Akt, and mTORC1, the Myc transcription factor has important metabolic roles beyond enhancing glycolysis. Myc promotes mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis (Li et al., 2005Li F. Wang Y. Zeller K.I. Potter J.J. Wonsey D.R. O'Donnell K.A. Kim J.W. Yustein J.T. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6225-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Oncogenic Myc has also been shown to promote the mitochondrial utilization of glutamine by enhancing the expression of glutaminase (GLS), which deamidates glutamine to glutamate. Cells expressing oncogenic Myc are glutamine-addicted and undergo apoptosis when glutamine is withdrawn from the culture medium. While the role of glutamine as a nitrogen donor is important for the proliferation of these cells, their viability depends on glutamine as a carbon source for mitochondrial metabolism (DeBerardinis et al., 2007DeBerardinis R.J.

Oefner P. Sachidanandam R. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, it was observed that the growth of tumor xenografts from Myc-expressing B cells can be impaired by pharmacological inhibition of GLS (Le et al., 2012Le A. Lane A.N. Hamaker M. Bose S. Gouw A. Barbi J. Tsukamoto T. Rojas C.J. Slusher B.S. Zhang H. et al.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 110-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data provide further evidence that reprogrammed glutamine metabolism is critical to the growth and survival of Myc-driven malignancies. Upstream of Myc, RhoGTPases have also been linked to the activation of GLS and glutamine dependence. Either siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of GLS can inhibit Rho-GTPase-induced transformation and proliferation (Wang et al., 2010Wang J.B. Erickson J.W. Fuji R. Ramachandran S. Gao P. Dinavahi R. Wilson K.F. Ambrosio A.L. Dias S.M. Dang C.V. Cerione R.A. Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The weight of the evidence to date supports the concept that reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a primary and fundamental aspect of transformation resulting from mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Proliferative metabolism is heavily dependent on the reprogramming of mitochondria to serve a synthetic rather than a degradative role. Metabolic changes associated with proliferating cells do not simply occur passively in response to damaged mitochondria or changes in ATP levels. A related concept concerns the possibility that proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors arose in evolution as components of metabolic regulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, activation of the tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to be critical for cell survival following glucose depletion (Jones et al., 2005Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports have linked this metabolic stress response of p53 to increased fatty acid oxidation (Assaily et al., 2011Assaily W. Rubinger D.A. Wheaton K. Lin Y. Ma W. Xuan W. Brown-Endres L. Tsuchihara K. Mak T.W. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Zaugg et al., 2011Zaugg K. Yao Y. Reilly P.T. Kannan K. Kiarash R. Mason J. Huang P. Sawyer S.K. Fuerth B. Faubert B. et al.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In tumors, the loss of p53 can enhance glycolysis and anabolic synthesis from glycolytic intermediates (Bensaad et al., 2006Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, Kondoh et al., 2005Kondoh H. Lleonart M.E. Gil J. Wang J. Degan P. Peters G.

Science. 2006; 312: 1650-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). However, mitochondrial metabolism continues to be critical in cells with metabolic reprogramming arising from p53 loss. Treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin, an inhibitor of complex 1 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (El-Mir et al., 2000El-Mir M.Y. Nogueira V. Fontaine E. Av\u00e9ret N. Rigoulet M. Leverve X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, Owen et al., 2000Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is especially toxic to p53-deficient tumor cells (Buzzai et al., 2007Buzzai M. Jones R.G. Amaravadi R.K. Lum J.J. DeBerardinis R.J. Zhao F. Viollet B. Thompson C.B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6745-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Oncogenic mutations in proto-oncogenes can be selected for in tumor populations subjected to metabolic stress. Yun et al., 2009Yun J. Rago C. Cheong I. Pagliarini R. Angenendt P. Rajagopalan H. Schmidt K. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Zhou S. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar showed that depriving colon carcinoma cells of glucose increased the rate at which activating mutations in Ras grew out. Surviving clones were better able to cope with limited glucose due to their upregulation of the transporter GLUT1. Some clones demonstrated KRAS mutations, and mutant KRAS was shown to upregulate GLUT1 expression and confer sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition. Importantly, increased glycolytic metabolism from activated Ras does not stem from defective mitochondrial pathways. Even for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis, the importance of intact mitochondrial oxidative metabolism has been confirmed in vivo (Guo et al., 2011Guo J.Y. Chen H.Y. Mathew R. Fan J. Strohecker A.M. Karsli-Uzunbas G. Kamphorst J.J. Chen G. Lemons J.M. Karantza V. et al.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Weinberg et al., 2010Weinberg F. Hamanaka R. Wheaton W.W. Weinberg S. Joseph J. Lopez M. Kalyanaraman B. Mutlu G.M. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 8788-8793Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition to activating oncogenes like Ras, preferentially expressing specific isoforms of metabolic enzymes can provide cancer cells with a mechanism to select for metabolic alterations during tumorigenesis. For example, proliferating cells almost universally express the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase M (PKM2). Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, with concomitant generation of ATP. In contrast to the M1 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM1) that is the predominant isoform in most adult differentiated tissues, the PKM2 splice variant is the major isoform in embryonic tissues and in all cancer cells examined to date (Mazurek, 2011Mazurek S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Other significant genes for proliferative cell metabolism are also alternatively spliced. The phosphofructokinase\/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase B3 gene (PFKFB3) is highly expressed in human tumors and has six splice variants. Two splice variants predominate in high-grade astrocytoma and colon carcinoma and enhance glycolytic flux, while other splice variants are limited to low-grade tumors and normal tissues (Bando et al., 2005Bando H. Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Mishima S. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Zscharnack et al., 2009Zscharnack K. Kessler R. Bleichert F. Warnke J.P. Eschrich K. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2009; 35: 566-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced isoform of GLS may also be important for the mitochondrial glutamine metabolism of tumor cells (Cassago et al., 2012Cassago A. Ferreira A.P. Ferreira I.M. Fornezari C. Gomes E.R. Greene K.S. Pereira H.M. Garratt R.C. Dias S.M. Ambrosio A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized of these alternatively spliced metabolic enzymes remains pyruvate kinase. The preferential expression of PKM2 in proliferating cells suggested a protumorigenic role for this splice variant, and xenograft models subsequently demonstrated that PKM2-expressing cells have a growth advantage in vivo compared with PKM1-expressing cells (Christofk et al., 2008aChristofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, in what might seem paradoxical for an isoform associated with proliferating and highly glycolytic cells, PKM2 has intrinsically lower enzymatic activity than PKM1. PKM2 is a",

    "text":"A Molecular View of Microbial Diversity and the Biosphere. Over three decades of molecular-phylogenetic studies, researchers have compiled an increasingly robust map of evolutionary diversification showing that the main diversity of life is microbial, distributed among three primary relatedness groups or domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya. The general properties of representatives of the three domains indicate that the earliest life was based on inorganic nutrition and that photosynthesis and use of organic compounds for carbon and energy metabolism came comparatively later. The application of molecular-phylogenetic methods to study natural microbial ecosystems without the traditional requirement for cultivation has resulted in the discovery of many unexpected evolutionary lineages; members of some of these lineages are only distantly related to known organisms but are sufficiently abundant that they are likely to have impact on the chemistry of the biosphere.",

    "text":"Spatial partitioning of the regulatory landscape of the X-inactivation centre. In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist\/Tsix sense\/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.",

    "text":"Escape from Flatland: Increasing Saturation as an Approach to Improving Clinical Success. The medicinal chemistry community has become increasingly aware of the value of tracking calculated physical properties such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area, rotatable bonds, and hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. We hypothesized that the shift to high-throughput synthetic practices over the past decade may be another factor that may predispose molecules to fail by steering discovery efforts toward achiral, aromatic compounds. We have proposed two simple and interpretable measures of the complexity of molecules prepared as potential drug candidates. The first is carbon bond saturation as defined by fraction sp(3) (Fsp(3)) where Fsp(3) = (number of sp(3) hybridized carbons\/total carbon count). The second is simply whether a chiral carbon exists in the molecule. We demonstrate that both complexity (as measured by Fsp(3)) and the presence of chiral centers correlate with success as compounds transition from discovery, through clinical testing, to drugs. In an attempt to explain these observations, we further demonstrate that saturation correlates with solubility, an experimental physical property important to success in the drug discovery setting.",

The use of 15N-labeled compounds to obtain specific uptake rates for the various nitrogen sources available to the phytoplankton makes it possible to separate the fractions of primary productivity corresponding to new and regenerated nitrogen in the euphotic zone of the ocean. Measurements of nitrate uptake as a fraction of ammonia plus nitrate uptake have been obtained from the northwest Atlantic and the northeast Pacific oceans. Mean values range from 8.3 to 39.5%, the former being characteristic of subtropical regions and the latter of northern temperate regions or coastal and inland waters. Nitrogen fixation is also a source of new nitrogen. Rates of nitrogen fixation are found to be as high or higher than nitrate uptake, in some cases suggesting an important role for nitrogen-fixing phytoplankton.

The urgent need of clean and renewable energy drives the exploration of effective strategies to produce molecular hydrogen. With the assistance of highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts, electrolysis of water is becoming a promising candidate to generate pure hydrogen with low cost and high efficiency. Very recently, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been proven to be high performance catalysts with high activity, high stability, and nearly \u223c100% Faradic efficiency in not only strong acidic solutions, but also in strong alkaline and neutral media for electrochemical hydrogen evolution. In this tutorial review, an overview of recent development of TMP nanomaterials as catalysts for hydrogen generation with high activity and stability is presented. The effects of phosphorus (P) on HER activity, and their synthetic methods of TMPs are briefly discussed. Then we will demonstrate the specific strategies to further improve the catalytic efficiency and stability of TMPs by structural engineering. Making use of TMPs as cocatalysts and catalysts in photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting is also discussed. Finally, some key challenges and issues which should not be ignored during the rapid development of TMPs are pointed out. These strategies and challenges of TMPs are instructive for designing other high-performance non-noble metal catalysts.",

    "text":"A review on phase change energy storage: materials and applications. Latent heat storage is one of the most efficient ways of storing thermal energy. Unlike the sensible heat storage method, the latent heat storage method provides much higher storage density, with a smaller temperature difference between storing and releasing heat. This paper reviews previous work on latent heat storage and provides an insight to recent efforts to develop new classes of phase change materials (PCMs) for use in energy storage. Three aspects have been the focus of this review: PCM materials, encapsulation and applications. There are large numbers of phase change materials that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. Paraffin waxes are cheap and have moderate thermal energy storage density but low thermal conductivity and, hence, require large surface area. Hydrated salts have larger energy storage density and higher thermal conductivity but experience supercooling and phase segregation, and hence, their application requires the use of some nucleating and thickening agents. The main advantages of PCM encapsulation are providing large heat transfer area, reduction of the PCMs reactivity towards the outside environment and controlling the changes in volume of the storage materials as phase change occurs. The different applications in which the phase change method of heat storage can be applied are also reviewed in this paper. The problems associated with the application of PCMs with regards to the material and the methods used to contain them are also discussed.",

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is one of the first Earth observation satellites being developed by NASA in response to the National Research Council's Decadal Survey. SMAP will make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the Earth's land surface and will distinguish frozen from thawed land surfaces. Direct observations of soil moisture and freeze\/thaw state from space will allow significantly improved estimates of water, energy, and carbon transfers between the land and the atmosphere. The accuracy of numerical models of the atmosphere used in weather prediction and climate projections are critically dependent on the correct characterization of these transfers. Soil moisture measurements are also directly applicable to flood assessment and drought monitoring. SMAP observations can help monitor these natural hazards, resulting in potentially great economic and social benefits. SMAP observations of soil moisture and freeze\/thaw timing will also reduce a major uncertainty in quantifying the global carbon balance by helping to resolve an apparent missing carbon sink on land over the boreal latitudes. The SMAP mission concept will utilize L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna to provide high-resolution and high-accuracy global maps of soil moisture and freeze\/thaw state every two to three days. In addition, the SMAP project will use these observations with advanced modeling and data assimilation to provide deeper root-zone soil moisture and net ecosystem exchange of carbon.

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify \u223c2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect \u223c580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation. An extensive map of human DNase I hypersensitive sites, markers of regulatory DNA, in 125 diverse cell and tissue types is described; integration of this information with other ENCODE-generated data sets identifies new relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns.

We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF\/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF\/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal\/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal\/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal\/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF\/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.",

Oxygen homeostasis represents an organizing principle for understanding metazoan evolution, development, physiology, and pathobiology. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional activators that function as master regulators of oxygen homeostasis in all metazoan species. Rapid progress is being made in elucidating homeostatic roles of HIFs in many physiological systems, determining pathological consequences of HIF dysregulation in chronic diseases, and investigating potential targeting of HIFs for therapeutic purposes. Oxygen is central to biology because it is used during respiration. O2 serves as the final electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation, which carries with it the risk of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS react with cellular macromolecules and alter their biochemical or physical properties, resulting in cell dysfunction or death. As a consequence, metazoan organisms have evolved elaborate cellular metabolic and systemic physiological systems that are designed to maintain oxygen homeostasis. This Review focuses on the role of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) as master regulators of oxygen homeostasis and, in particular, on recent advances in understanding their roles in physiology and medicine. Due to space limitations and the remarkably pleiotropic effects of HIFs, the description of such roles will be illustrative rather than comprehensive. O2 started accumulating in Earth's atmosphere \u223c2.5 billion years ago. Increased availability of atmospheric O2 led to the evolution of an extraordinarily efficient system of oxidative phosphorylation that transfers chemical energy stored in carbon bonds of organic molecules to the high-energy phosphate bond in ATP, which is used to power physicochemical reactions in living cells. Energy produced by mitochondrial respiration is sufficient to power the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms, which could not be sustained by energy produced by glycolysis alone (Lane and Martin, 2010Lane N. Martin W. The energetics of genome complexity.Nature. 2010; 467: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The dimensions of primitive metazoan species were small enough that O2 could diffuse from the atmosphere to all of the organism's thousand cells, as is the case for the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. To escape the constraints placed on organismal growth by diffusion, systems evolved that could conduct air to cells deep within the body, and these designs were sufficient for O2 delivery to organisms with hundreds of thousands of cells, such as the fly Drosophila melanogaster. The final leap in body scale occurred in vertebrates, and it was associated with the evolution of complex respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems designed to efficiently capture and distribute O2 to hundreds of millions of millions of cells, such as the adult Homo sapiens. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is expressed by all extant metazoan species analyzed to date (Loenarz et al., 2011Loenarz C. Coleman M.L. Boleininger A. Schierwater B. Holland P.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor pathway regulates oxygen sensing in the simplest animal, Trichoplax adhaerens.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). HIF-1 consists of the subunits HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2. Each subunit contains basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) domains (Wang et al., 1995Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS heterodimer regulated by cellular O2 tension.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) that mediate heterodimerization and DNA binding (Jiang et al., 1996aJiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. Dimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation properties of hypoxia-inducible factor 1.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). HIF-1\u03b2 heterodimerizes with other bHLH-PAS proteins and is present in excess, such that HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels determine HIF-1 transcriptional activity (Semenza et al., 1996Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. Hypoxia response elements in the aldolase A, enolase 1, and lactate dehydrogenase A gene promoters contain essential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Under well-oxygenated conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 is bound by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. VHL recruits an ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF-1\u03b1 for proteasomal degradation (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Oxygen sensing by metazoans: the central role of the HIF hydroxylase pathway.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). VHL binding is dependent upon hydroxylation of a specific proline residue in HIF-1\u03b1 by the prolyl hydroxylase PHD2. PHD2 uses O2 as a substrate, and thus, its activity is inhibited under hypoxic conditions (Epstein et al., 2001Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. et al.C. elegans EGL-9 and mammalian homologs define a family of dioxygenases that regulate HIF by prolyl hydroxylation.Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). In the reaction, one oxygen atom is inserted into the prolyl residue, and the other atom is inserted into the cosubstrate \u03b1-ketoglutarate, splitting it into CO2 and succinate (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Oxygen sensing by metazoans: the central role of the HIF hydroxylase pathway.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). Factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) represses HIF-1\u03b1 transactivation function (Mahon et al., 2001Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. FIH-1: a novel protein that interacts with HIF-1\u03b1 and VHL to mediate repression of HIF-1 transcriptional activity.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). It hydroxylates an asparaginyl residue on HIF-1\u03b1, using O2 and \u03b1-ketoglutarate as substrates, thereby blocking the association of HIF-1\u03b1 with the p300 coactivator protein (Lando et al., 2002Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase enzyme that regulates the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), which is a competitive antagonist of \u03b1-ketoglutarate, inhibits hydroxylases and induces HIF-1-dependent transcription (Epstein et al., 2001Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. et al.C. elegans EGL-9 and mammalian homologs define a family of dioxygenases that regulate HIF by prolyl hydroxylation.Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). HIF-1 activity is also induced by iron chelators (e.g., desferrioxamine) and cobalt chloride, which inhibit hydroxylases by displacing Fe(II) from the catalytic center (Epstein et al., 2001Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I.

Studies in cultured cells (Jiang et al., 1996bJiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 levels vary exponentially over a physiologically relevant range of O2 tension.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated, perfused, and ventilated lung preparations (Yu et al., 1998Yu A.Y. Frid M.G. Shimoda L.A. Wiener C.M. Stenmark K. Semenza G.L. Temporal, spatial, and oxygen-regulated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in the lung.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L818-L826PubMed Google Scholar) revealed an exponential increase in HIF-1\u03b1 levels at O2 concentrations <6% (\u223c40 mm Hg), which cannot be explained by known biochemical properties of the hydroxylases. In most adult tissues, O2 concentrations are in the range of 3%\u20135%, and any decrease occurs along the steep portion of the dose-response curve, allowing a graded response to hypoxia. Analyses of cultured human cells have revealed that expression of hundreds of genes was increased in response to hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner (as determined by RNA interference) with direct binding of HIF-1 to the gene (as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] assays). In addition, the expression of hundreds of genes was decreased in response to hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner, but binding of HIF-1 to these genes was not detected (Mole et al., 2009Mole D.R. Blancher C. Copley R.R. Pollard P.J. Gleadle J.M. Ragoussis J. Ratcliffe P.J. Genome-wide association of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 DNA binding with expression profiling of hypoxia-inducible transcripts.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16767-16775Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These results indicate that HIF-dependent repression occurs via indirect mechanisms, which include HIF-1-dependent expression of transcriptional repressors (Yun et al., 2002Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Inhibition of PPAR gamma 2 gene expression by the HIF-1-regulated gene DEC1\/Stra13: a mechanism for regulation of adipogenesis by hypoxia.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and microRNAs (Kulshreshtha et al., 2007Kulshreshtha R. Ferracin M. Wojcik S.E. Garzon R. Alder H. Agosto-Perez F.J. Davuluri R. Liu C.G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. et al.A microRNA signature of hypoxia.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). ChIP-seq studies have revealed that only 40% of HIF-1-binding sites are located within 2.5 kb of the transcription start site (Sch\u00f6del et al., 2011Sch\u00f6del J. Oikonomopoulos S. Ragoussis J. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Mole D.R. High-resolution genome-wide mapping of HIF-binding sites by ChIP-seq.Blood. 2011; 117: e207-e217Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, HIF-2\u03b1 is a paralog of HIF-1\u03b1 that is also regulated by prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation. HIF-2\u03b1 also dimerizes with HIF-1\u03b2, but it is expressed in a cell-restricted manner and plays important roles in erythropoiesis, vascularization, and pulmonary development. In D. melanogaster, the gene encoding the HIF-1\u03b1 ortholog is designated similar, and its paralog is designated trachealess because inactivating mutations result in defective development of the tracheal tubes (Wilk et al., 1996Wilk R. Weizman I. Shilo B.Z. trachealess encodes a bHLH-PAS protein that is an inducer of tracheal cell fates in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, C. elegans has only a single HIF-1\u03b1 homolog (Epstein et al., 2001Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. et al.C. elegans EGL-9 and mammalian homologs define a family of dioxygenases that regulate HIF by prolyl hydroxylation.Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). Thus, in both invertebrates and vertebrates, the evolution of specialized systems for O2 delivery was associated with the appearance of a HIF-1\u03b1 paralog. The regulation of metabolism is a principal and primordial function of HIF-1. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 mediates a transition from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism through its regulation of four factors: PDK1, LDHA, BNIP3, and BNIP3L. PDK1 encodes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 1, which phosphorylates and inactivates PDH, thereby inhibiting the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Kim et al., 2006Kim J.W. Tchernyshyov I. Semenza G.L. Dang C.V.

HIF-1 mediates adaptation to hypoxia by actively downregulating mitochondrial oxygen consumption.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). LDHA encodes lactate dehydrogenase A, which converts pyruvate to lactate (Semenza et al., 1996Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. Hypoxia response elements in the aldolase A, enolase 1, and lactate dehydrogenase A gene promoters contain essential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Finally, BNIP3 (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang H. Bosch-Marce M. Shimoda L.A. Tan Y.S. Baek J.H. Wesley J.B. Gonzalez F.J. Semenza G.L. Mitochondrial autophagy is an HIF-1-dependent adaptive metabolic response to hypoxia.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10892-10903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) and BNIP3L (Bellot et al., 2009Bellot G. Garcia-Medina R. Gounon P. Chiche J. Roux D. Pouyss\u00e9gur J. Mazure N.M. Hypoxia-induced autophagy is mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor induction of BNIP3 and BNIP3L via their BH3 domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) mediate selective mitochondrial autophagy (Figure 1). HIF-1 also mediates a subunit switch in cytochrome c oxidase that improves the efficiency of electron transfer under hypoxic conditions (Fukuda et al., 2007Fukuda R. Zhang H. Kim J.W. Shimoda L. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. HIF-1 regulates cytochrome oxidase subunits to optimize efficiency of respiration in hypoxic cells.Cell. 2007; 129: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). An analogous subunit switch is also observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although it is mediated by a completely different mechanism (yeast lack HIF-1). This conservation suggests that the subunit switch in cytochrome c oxidase may represent a fundamental response of eukaryotic cells to hypoxia. It is conventional wisdom that cells switch to glycolysis for ATP production when O2 becomes limiting. Yet, HIF-1\u03b1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts, which do not downregulate respiration under hypoxic conditions, have higher ATP levels at 1% O2 than wild-type cells at 20% O2, demonstrating that under these conditions O2 is not limiting for ATP production (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang H. Bosch-Marce M. Shimoda L.A. Tan Y.S. Baek J.H. Wesley J.B. Gonzalez F.J. Semenza G.L. Mitochondrial autophagy is an HIF-1-dependent adaptive metabolic response to hypoxia.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10892-10903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). However, the HIF-1\u03b1 null cells die under prolonged hypoxic conditions due to ROS toxicity (Kim et al., 2006Kim J.W.

These studies have led to a paradigm shift with regard to our understanding of the regulation of cellular metabolism (Semenza, 2010Semenza G.L. Defining the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in cancer biology and therapeutics.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar): the purpose of switching to glycolysis is to prevent excess mitochondrial generation of ROS that would otherwise occur due to the reduced efficiency of electron transfer under hypoxic conditions (Chandel et al., 1998Chandel N.S.

Much of mammalian embryogenesis occurs at O2 concentrations of 1%\u20135%, and O2 functions as a morphogen (through HIFs) in many developmental systems (Dunwoodie, 2009Dunwoodie S.L.

Mice that are homozygous for a null allele at the locus encoding HIF-1\u03b1 die by embryonic day 10.5 with cardiac malformations, vascular defects, and impaired erythropoiesis. Thus, all three components of the circulatory system are dependent upon HIF-1 for normal development (Iyer et al., 1998Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M.

Depending on the genetic background, mice lacking HIF-2\u03b1 die by embryonic day 12.5 with vascular defects (Peng et al., 2000Peng J. Zhang L. Drysdale L. Fong G.H.

Thus, although vertebrate evolution was associated with concomitant appearance of the circulatory system and HIF-2\u03b1, both HIF-1 and HIF-2 have important roles in circulatory system development.

Although knockout mouse experiments point to the adverse effects of HIF-1 loss of function on development, it is also possible that increased HIF-1 activity, induced by hypoxia in embryonic tissues as a result of abnormalities in placental blood flow, may also dysregulate development and result in congenital malformations. For example, HIF-1\u03b1 has been shown to interact with and stimulate the transcriptional activity of Notch, which plays a key role in many developmental pathways (Gustafsson et al., 2005Gustafsson M.V. Zheng X. Pereira T. Gradin K. Jin S. Lundkvist J. Ruas J.L. Poellinger L. Lendahl U. Bondesson M. Hypoxia requires notch signaling to maintain the undifferentiated cell state.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Heart disease is the major cause of mortality in the United States population. The formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the main coronary arteries leads to insufficient myocardial perfusion, especially when heart work and O2 consumption are increased. A physiological response to myocardial ischemia (inadequate perfusion of the heart muscle) is the remodeling of collateral blood vessels to accept increased flow and thereby bypass stenotic regions, where lumenal diameter and blood flow are reduced. Two-thirds of patients with critical narrowing of a coronary artery (>70% reduction in diameter) have one or more collateral vessels. When rupture of atherosclerotic plaques results in complete coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction (MI; \u201cheart attack\u201d), patients with collaterals are likely to have smaller infarcts (areas of tissue necrosis) and are more likely to survive. In patients with critical coronary stenosis, the frequency of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that changes proline to serine at residue 582 of HIF-1\u03b1 was 5-fold greater among those without collaterals compared to those with collaterals (Resar et al., 2005Resar J.R. Roguin A. Voner J. Nasir K. Hennebry T.A. Miller J.M. Ingersoll R. Kasch L.M. Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 polymorphism and coronary collaterals in patients with ischemic heart disease.Chest. 2005; 128: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This SNP and two others at the HIF1A locus were associated with stable exertional angina (chest pain during exercise) rather than MI as the initial clinical presentation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (Hlatky et al., 2007Hlatky M.A. Quertermous T. Boothroyd D.B. Priest J.R. Glassford A.J. Myers R.M. Fortmann S.P. Iribarren C. Tabor H.K. Assimes T.L. et al.Polymorphisms in hypoxia inducible factor 1 and the initial clinical presentation of coronary disease.Am. Heart J. 2007; 154: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Coronary stenosis and collaterals were not analyzed in this latter study, making interpretation of the data difficult. However, taken together these two clinical studies suggest that HIF1A is a major genetic modifier in CAD. The remodeling of collateral vessels provides a means to increase O2 delivery and thereby eliminate hypoxia. However, in the short-term, cells must adapt to survive O2 deprivation, such as by shifting from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. The powerful nature of these adaptations is illustrated by the preconditioning phenomenon, in which exposure of the heart to short periods (e.g., 5 min [I5]) of ischemia, caused by occlusion of a coronary artery, followed by short periods (e.g., 5 min [R5]) of reperfusion (recovery of blood flow) protect the heart against subsequent episodes of prolonged ischemia (e.g., 30 min [I30]). Hearts from Hif1a+\/\u2212 mice (heterozygous for a null allele at the Hif1a locus) show a complete loss of preconditioning (Cai et al., 2008Cai Z. Zhong H. Bosch-Marce M. Fox-Talbot K. Wang L. Wei C. Trush M.A. Semenza G.L. Complete loss of ischaemic preconditioning-induced cardioprotection in mice with partial deficiency of HIF-1 \u03b1.Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 77: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on glucose metabolism, HIF-1 activates genes encoding enzymes that generate adenosine, a signaling molecule that mediates preconditioning (Eckle et al., 2008Eckle T. K\u00f6hler D. Lehmann R. El Kasmi K. Eltzschig H.K. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is central to cardioprotection: a new paradigm for ischemic preconditioning.Circulation. 2008; 118: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The cardiac protection afforded by a preconditioning protocol lasting less than 1 hr (I5-R5-I5-R5-I30) is dependent on HIF-1, indicating that HIF-1-dependent transcription and subsequent translation occur with remarkable rapidity. Atherosclerotic stenosis of major arteries in the legs results in ischemia that is manifested by intermittent claudication (leg pain during walking). This can progress to critical limb ischemia in which blood flow is not sufficient to maintain tissue viability, resulting in pain at rest and gangrene (tissue necrosis) that eventually necessitates limb amputation. The incidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the general population is \u223c5%, whereas \u223c20% of individuals over 70 years old have PAD, and 1%\u20132% of PAD patients develop critical limb ischemia. Limb ischemia induced in experimental animals by ligation of the femoral artery results in increased HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels and HIF-1-dependent expression of downstream target genes, encoding multiple angiogenic growth factors. These factors include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), placental growth factor, angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, platelet-derived growth factor B, and stem cell factor. In addition, bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells (BMDACs) are recruited to the ischemic tissue and, together with the local effects of angiogenic factors, promote the recovery of tissue perfusion. All of these responses to limb ischemia are impaired in older mice and in Hif1a+\/\u2212 mice (Bosch-Marce et al., 2007Bosch-Marce M. Okuyama H. Wesley J.B. Sarkar K. Kimura H. Liu Y.V. Zhang H. Strazza M. Rey S. Savino L. et al.Effects of aging and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity on angiogenic cell mobilization and recovery of perfusion after limb ischemia.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Clinical trials that target a single angiogenic factor (e.g., VEGF) have failed to promote recovery of patients with PAD. The observation that HIF-1 is a master regulator, which is responsible for the coordinated induction of multiple angiogenic factors, suggested that it may represent a better therapeutic target than a single angiogenic factor. AdCA5 is a recombinant adenovirus encoding an engineered form of HIF-1\u03b1 that is constitutively active. A single intramuscular injection of AdCA5 into the ischemic limb was sufficient to overcome the impaired recovery of blood flow following femoral artery ligation in 8-month-old mice, but it was not effective in 13-month-old mice (Bosch-Marce et al., 2007Bosch-Marce M.

    "text":"Plant Ecological Strategies: Some Leading Dimensions of Variation Between Species. \u25aa Abstract An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area\u2013leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass\u2013seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size\u2013twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.",

Enhancing the efficiency of the synthesis of complex organic products constitutes one of the most exciting challenges to the synthetic chemist. Increasing the catalogue of reactions that are simple additions or that minimize waste production is the necessary first step. Transition metal complexes, which can be tunable both electronically and sterically by varying the metal and\/or ligands, are a focal point for such invention. Except for catalytic hydrogenation, such methods have been rare in complex synthesis and virtually unknown for CC bond formation until the advent of cross-coupling reactions. These complexes may orchestrate a variety of CC bond-forming processes, important for creation of the basic skeleton of the organic structure. Their ability to insert into CH bonds primes a number of different types of additions to relatively nonpolar \u03c0-electron systems. Besides imparting selectivity, they make feasible reactions that uncatalyzed were previously unknown. The ability of these complexes to preorganize \u03c0-electron systems serves as the basis both of simple additions usually accompanied by subsequent hydrogen shifts and of cycloadditions. The ability to generate \u201creactive\u201d intermediates under mild conditions also provides prospects for new types of CC bond-forming reactions.

    "text":"The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and their energy, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions implications: An overview. This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400\u20131200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W\/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 \u00b0C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).",

This paper presents a modeling approach aimed at seasonal resolution of global climatic and edaphic controls on patterns of terrestrial ecosystem production and soil microbial respiration.

The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) Biosphere model runs on a monthly time interval to simulate seasonal patterns in net plant carbon fixation, biomass and nutrient allocation, litterfall, soil nitrogen mineralization, and microbial CO2 production.

Pathogenic fungi are increasingly contributing to the global emerging disease burden, threatening biodiversity and imposing increasing costs on ecosystem health, hence steps must be taken to tighten biosecurity worldwide to reduce the rate of fungal disease emergence. Fungal infections have caused widespread damage in crops and dramatic decline in populations of amphibians and bats. In recent years newly emerged pathogenic fungi have been reported in corals, bees and many plant species. In this Review, Matthew Fisher and colleagues warn that human activity is intensifying fungal-disease dispersal by modifying natural ecosystems and creating new opportunities for evolution. Unless steps are taken to reduce the risk of these infectious diseases spreading globally, the authors suggest, fungal infections will cause increasing attrition of biodiversity, with wider implications for human and ecosystem health. The authors' recommendations include better monitoring of emerging diseases, stringent biosecurity controls on international trade and intensified research on the interactions between hosts, pathogens and the environment. The past two decades have seen an increasing number of virulent infectious diseases in natural populations and managed landscapes. In both animals and plants, an unprecedented number of fungal and fungal-like diseases have recently caused some of the most severe die-offs and extinctions ever witnessed in wild species, and are jeopardizing food security. Human activity is intensifying fungal disease dispersal by modifying natural environments and thus creating new opportunities for evolution.

We also show, in contrast, that bacteriostatic drugs do not produce hydroxyl radicals. We demonstrate that the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation induced by bactericidal antibiotics is the end product of an oxidative damage cellular death pathway involving the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a transient depletion of NADH, destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters, and stimulation of the Fenton reaction. Our results suggest that all three major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by targeting bacterial systems that remediate hydroxyl radical damage, including proteins involved in triggering the DNA damage response, e.g., RecA.",

Trenberth* National Center for Atmospheric Research, Box 3000, Boulder, Colorado 80307, USA *Email: trenbert@ucar.edu ABSTRACT: There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1\u00b0C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: \u2018it never rains but it pours!\u2019 This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the \u2018rich get richer and the poor get poorer\u2019. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. \u2018more bang for the buck\u2019, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni\u00f1o a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.

The application of bio-char (charcoal or biomass-derived black carbon (C)) to soil is pro- posed as a novel approach to establish a significant, long-term, sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in terrestrial ecosystems. Apart from positive effects in both reducing emissions and increasing the sequestration of greenhouse gases, the production of bio-char and its application to soil will deliver im- mediate benefits through improved soil fertility and increased crop production. Conversion of biomass C to bio-char C leads to sequestration of about 50% of the initial C compared to the low amounts retained after burning (3%) and biological decomposition (<10-20% after 5-10 years), therefore yielding more stable soil C than burning or direct land application of biomass. This efficiency of C conversion of biomass to bio-char is highly dependent on the type of feedstock, but is not significantly affected by the pyrolysis temperature (within 350-500 \u25e6 C common for pyrolysis). Existing slash-and- burn systems cause significant degradation of soil and release of greenhouse gases and opportunies may exist to enhance this system by conversion to slash-and-char systems. Our global analysis revealed that up to 12% of the total anthropogenic C emissions by land use change (0.21 Pg C) can be off-set annually in soil, if slash-and-burn is replaced by slash-and-char. Agricultural and forestry wastes such as forest residues, mill residues, field crop residues, or urban wastes add a conservatively estimated 0.16 Pg C yr \u22121 . Biofuel production using modern biomass can produce a bio-char by-product through pyrolysis which results in 30.6 kg C sequestration for each GJ of energy produced. Using published projections of the use of renewable fuels in the year 2100, bio-char sequestration could amount to 5.5-9.5 Pg C yr \u22121 if this demand for energy was met through pyrolysis, which would exceed current emissions from fossil fuels (5.4 Pg C yr \u22121 ). Bio-char soil management systems can deliver tradable C emissions reduction, and C sequestered is easily accountable, and verifiable.",

Abstract We previously reported that the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was useful for predicting outcomes in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, the sample size of patients with scores of 1 or more, captured by the CCI, did not exceed 35%. Further, some comorbidities were rarely found among patients who underwent HCT. Therefore, the current study was designed to (1) better define previously identified comorbidities using pretransplant laboratory data, (2) investigate additional HCT-related comorbidities, and (3) establish comorbidity scores that were suited for HCT. Data were collected from 1055 patients, and then randomly divided into training and validation sets. Weights were assigned to individual comorbidities according to their prognostic significance in Cox proportional hazard models. The new index was then validated. The new index proved to be more sensitive than the CCI since it captured 62% of patients with scores more than 0 compared with 12%, respectively. Further, the new index showed better survival prediction than the CCI (likelihood ratio of 23.7 versus 7.1 and c statistics of 0.661 versus 0.561, respectively, P &amp;lt; .001). In conclusion, the new simple index provided valid and reliable scoring of pretransplant comorbidities that predicted nonrelapse mortality and survival. This index will be useful for clinical trials and patient counseling before HCT. (Blood. 2005;106: 2912-2919)",

    "text":"The Changing Character of Precipitation. From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR \u201cWater Cycle Across Scales\u201d initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.",

From the 4334 abstracts screened, 210 articles were selected that contained information on pathophysiology and treatment with relevance to primary care physicians.The glaucomas are a group of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting changes in the optic nerve head. Loss of ganglion cells is related to the level of intraocular pressure, but other factors may also play a role. Reduction of intraocular pressure is the only proven method to treat the disease. Although treatment is usually initiated with ocular hypotensive drops, laser trabeculoplasty and surgery may also be used to slow disease progression.Primary care physicians can play an important role in the diagnosis of glaucoma by referring patients with positive family history or with suspicious optic nerve head findings for complete ophthalmologic examination. They can improve treatment outcomes by reinforcing the importance of medication adherence and persistence and by recognizing adverse reactions from glaucoma medications and surgeries.",

Abstract This paper narrative argues that industrial economies have been locked into fossil fuel-based energy systems through a process of technological and institutional co-evolution driven by path-dependent increasing returns to scale. It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent market and policy failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages. The notion of a Techno-Institutional Complex is introduced to capture the idea that lock-in occurs through combined interactions among technological systems and governing institutions. While carbon lock-in provides a conceptual basis for understanding macro-level barriers to the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies, it also generates questions for standard economic modeling approaches that abstract away technological and institutional evolution in their elaboration. The question of escaping carbon lock-in is left for a future paper.",

Because of the particular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and tumor angiogenesis, it is possible to design drug delivery systems that specifically target anti-cancer drugs to tumors.

Therefore, the development of drug delivery systems able to target the tumor site is becoming a real challenge that is currently addressed. Nanomedicine can reach tumor passively through the leaky vasculature surrounding the tumors by the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect whereas ligands grafted at the surface of nanocarriers allow active targeting by binding to the receptors overexpressed by cancer cells or angiogenic endothelial cells. This review is divided into two parts: the first one describes the tumor microenvironment and the second one focuses on the exploitation and the understanding of these characteristics to design new drug delivery systems targeting the tumor.

The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract.

The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs.

Abstract Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10\u00a0m to 60\u00a0m depending on the spectral band with a 290\u00a0km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180\u00b0 providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.",

This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral\/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include IGBP DISCover, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote Sensing Land Cover.

    "text":"Synthesis, Structure, and Carbon Dioxide Capture Properties of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks. Zeolites are one of humanity\u2019s most important synthetic products. These aluminosilicate-based materials represent a large segment of the global economy. Indeed, the value of zeolites used in petroleum refining as catalysts and in detergents as water softeners is estimated at $350 billion per year. A major current goal in zeolite chemistry is to create a structure in which metal ions and functionalizable organic units make up an integral part of the framework. Such a structure, by virtue of the flexibility with which metal ions and organic moieties can be varied, is viewed as a key to further improving zeolite properties and accessing new applications. Recently, it was recognized that the Si\u2212O\u2212Si preferred angle in zeolites (145\u00b0) is coincident with that of the bridging angle in the M\u2212Im\u2212M fragment (where M is Zn or Co and Im is imidazolate), and therefore it should be possible to make new zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with topologies based on those of tetrahedral zeolites. This idea was successful and proved to be quite fruitful; within the last 5 years over 90 new ZIF structures have been reported. The recent application of high-throughput synthesis and characterization of ZIFs has expanded this structure space significantly: it is now possible to make ZIFs with topologies previously unknown in zeolites, in addition to mimicking known structures. In this Account, we describe the general preparation of crystalline ZIFs, discussing the methods that have been developed to create and analyze the variety of materials afforded. We include a comprehensive list of all known ZIFs, including structure, topology, and pore metrics. We also examine how complexity might be introduced into new structures, highlighting how link\u2212link interactions might be exploited to effect particular cage sizes, create polarity variations between pores, or adjust framework robustness, for example. The chemical and thermal stability of ZIFs permit many applications, such as the capture of CO2 and its selective separation from industrially relevant gas mixtures. Currently, ZIFs are the best porous materials for the selective capture of CO2; furthermore, they show exceptionally high capacity for CO2 among adsorbents operating by physisorption. The stability of ZIFs has also enabled organic transformations to be carried out on the crystals, yielding covalently functionalized isoreticular structures wherein the topology, crystallinity, and porosity of the ZIF structure are maintained throughout the reaction process. These reactions, being carried out on macroscopic crystals that behave as single molecules, have enabled the realization of the chemist\u2019s dream of using \u201ccrystals as molecules\u201d, opening the way for the application of the extensive library of organic reactions to the functionalization of useful extended porous structures.",

Nanofibers of polymers were electrospun by creating an electrically charged jet of polymer solution at a pendent droplet. After the jet flowed away from the droplet in a nearly straight line, it bent into a complex path and other changes in shape occurred, during which electrical forces stretched and thinned it by very large ratios. After the solvent evaporated, birefringent nanofibers were left. In this article the reasons for the instability are analyzed and explained using a mathematical model. The rheological complexity of the polymer solution is included, which allows consideration of viscoelastic jets. It is shown that the longitudinal stress caused by the external electric field acting on the charge carried by the jet stabilized the straight jet for some distance. Then a lateral perturbation grew in response to the repulsive forces between adjacent elements of charge carried by the jet. The motion of segments of the jet grew rapidly into an electrically driven bending instability. The three-dimensional paths of continuous jets were calculated, both in the nearly straight region where the instability grew slowly and in the region where the bending dominated the path of the jet. The mathematical model provides a reasonable representation of the experimental data, particularly of the jet paths determined from high speed videographic observations.",

To accomplish this, countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6\u20133.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.

Antioxidants (e.g., glutathione, arginine, citrulline, taurine, creatine, selenium, zinc, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin A, and tea polyphenols) and antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidases) exert synergistic actions in scavenging free radicals. There has been growing evidence over the past three decades showing that malnutrition (e.g., dietary deficiencies of protein, selenium, and zinc) or excess of certain nutrients (e.g., iron and vitamin C) gives rise to the oxidation of biomolecules and cell injury. A large body of the literature supports the notion that dietary antioxidants are useful radioprotectors and play an important role in preventing many human diseases (e.g., cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, neurodegeneration, and diabetes). The knowledge of enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative defense mechanisms will serve as a guiding principle for establishing the most effective nutrition support to ensure the biological safety of manned space missions.",

A number of recent studies have reported an ENSO-like EOF mode in the global sea surface temperature (SST) field, whose time variability is marked by an abrupt change toward a warmer tropical eastern Pacific and a colder extratropical central North Pacific in 1976\u201077. The present study compares this pattern with the structure of the interannual variability associated with the ENSO cycle and documents its time history back to 1900. The analysis is primarily based on the leading EOFs of the SST anomaly and \u2018\u2018anomaly deviation\u2019\u2019 fields in various domains and the associated expansion coefficient (or principal component) time series, which are used to construct global regression maps of SST, sea level pressure (SLP), and a number of related variables. The use of \u2018\u2018anomaly deviations\u2019\u2019 (i.e., departures of local SST anomalies from the concurrent global-mean SST anomaly) reduces the influence of global-mean SST trends upon the structure of the EOFs and their expansion coefficient time series. An important auxiliary time series used in this study is a \u2018\u2018Southern Oscillation index\u2019\u2019 based on marine surface observations. By means of several different analysis techniques, the time variability of the leading EOF of the global SST field is separated into two components: one identified with the \u2018\u2018ENSO cycle-related\u2019\u2019 variability on the interannual timescale, and the other a linearly independent \u2018\u2018residual\u2019\u2019 comprising all the interdecadal variability in the record. The two components exhibit rather similar spatial signatures in the global SST, SLP, and wind stress fields. The SST signature in the residual variability is less equatorially confined in the eastern Pacific and it is relatively more prominent over the extratropical North Pacific. The corresponding SLP signature is also stronger over the extratropical North Pacific, and its counterpart in the cold season 500-mb height field more closely resembles the PNA pattern. The amplitude time series of the ENSO-like pattern in the residual variability reflects the above-mentioned shift in 1976\u201077, as well as a number of other prominent features, including a shift of opposite polarity during the 1940s.",

Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss.

The in situ radionuclides can be used for a high-resolution tomography of the erosional history of an exposed surface; two stable nuclides (3He, 21Ne) and five radionuclides (10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 14C, 39Ar) having half-lives in the range of \u223c 300-1.5 \u00d7 106 yr half-life are measurable in many rock types.\r\n\r\nA prerequisite for the application of the in situ nuclides for the study of erosional histories of surfaces is a knowledge of their production rates under different irradiation conditions; altitude, latitude, irradiation geometry and shielding. Relative nuclide production rates can be determined fairly accurately using the extensive available data on cosmic ray neutrons [2]. Absolute nuclide production rates cannot generally be predicted with any accuracy because of lack of data on excitation functions of nuclides unless some normalization is possible, as was done in the case of several cosmic ray produced isotopes in the atmosphere [3]. Based on a recent natural calibration experiment in which erosion free surfaces exposed to cosmic radiation for \u223c 11,000 yrs were sampled, the absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been accurately estimated for mountain altitudes in Sierra Nevada [4]. The absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz can therefore be estimated fairly accurately for any given latitude and altitude. Some measurements of 14C in rocks of low erosion rate [5] similarly allow an estimate of its production rate. Attempts made to measure the in situ production rates of 3He in rocks have not yet led to a convergent production rate. In view of the importance of knowing the production rates of isotopes of He, Ne and Ar, I present here theoretical estimates of their production rates based on available cross-section data.\r\n\r\nI discuss the information that can be extracted from the study of the in situ nuclides in rocks.

The implications of these parameters for single and multiple nuclide studies are discussed in terms of the erosion models considered.",

Since the time of the industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen by nearly 35 % to its current level of 383 ppm.

To slow the increase, reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions are necessary. Large emission point sources, such as fossil-fuel-based power generation facilities, are the first targets for these reductions. A benchmark, mature technology for the separation of dilute CO2 from gas streams is via absorption with aqueous amines.

How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined.

The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1) is a modeling framework for estimating fluxes of biogenic compounds between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using simple mechanistic algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling biogenic emissions. It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, t-\u03b2-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17% of the total emission with the remaining 3% distributed among &gt;100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15% and 3%, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18% of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for ~80% of terpenoid emissions and ~50% of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10% of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables.

Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochemical properties that determine their interaction with biological substrates and processes. Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2, ZnO, and CeO2, were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines. ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissolution could happen in culture medium and endosomes. Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve. In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 positive endosomal compartments, respectively, in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity. Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS production and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress. Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects. These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biological responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as we developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.",

We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4.

The eddy covariance technique ascertains the exchange rate of CO2 across the interface between the atmosphere and a plant canopy by measuring the covariance between fluctuations in vertical wind velocity and CO2 mixing ratio. Two decades ago, the method was employed to study CO2 exchange of agricultural crops under ideal conditions during short field campaigns. During the past decade the eddy covariance method has emerged as an important tool for evaluating fluxes of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over the course of a year, and more. At present, the method is being applied in a nearly continuous mode to study carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange at over a hundred and eighty field sites, worldwide. The objective of this review is to assess the eddy covariance method as it is being applied by the global change community on increasingly longer time scales and over less than ideal surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe eddy covariance method is most accurate when the atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature, humidity, CO2) are steady, the underlying vegetation is homogeneous and it is situated on flat terrain for an extended distance upwind. When the eddy covariance method is applied over natural and complex landscapes or during atmospheric conditions that vary with time, the quantification of CO2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere must include measurements of atmospheric storage, flux divergence and advection.\r\n\r\nAveraging CO2 flux measurements over long periods (days to year) reduces random sampling error to relatively small values. Unfortunately, data gaps are inevitable when constructing long data records. Data gaps are generally filled with values produced from statistical and empirical models to produce daily and annual sums of CO2 exchange. Filling data gaps with empirical estimates do not introduce significant bias errors because the empirical algorithms are derived from large statistical populations. On the other hand, flux measurement errors can be biased at night when winds are light and intermittent. Nighttime bias errors tend to produce an underestimate in the measurement of ecosystem respiration.\r\n\r\nDespite the sources of errors associated with long-term eddy flux measurements, many investigators are producing defensible estimates of annual carbon exchange. When measurements come from nearly ideal sites the error bound on the net annual exchange of CO2 is less than \u00b150\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121.

The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.",

Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A \u2018mass ratio\u2019 theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.",

The parametrization and validation of the OPLS3 force field for small molecules and proteins are reported. Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein-ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal\/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.",

    "text":"An overview of current status of carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies. Abstract Global warming and climate change concerns have triggered global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered a crucial strategy for meeting CO2 emission reduction targets. In this paper, various aspects of CCS are reviewed and discussed including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. The selection of specific CO2 capture technology heavily depends on the type of CO2 generating plant and fuel used. Among those CO2 separation processes, absorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its higher efficiency and lower cost. Pipeline is considered to be the most viable solution for large volume of CO2 transport. Among those geological formations for CO2 storage, enhanced oil recovery is mature and has been practiced for many years but its economical viability for anthropogenic sources needs to be demonstrated. There are growing interests in CO2 storage in saline aquifers due to their enormous potential storage capacity and several projects are in the pipeline for demonstration of its viability. There are multiple hurdles to CCS deployment including the absence of a clear business case for CCS investment and the absence of robust economic incentives to support the additional high capital and operating costs of the whole CCS process.",

The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W\/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution.",

The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.",

    "text":"Resistance, resilience, and redundancy in microbial communities. Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.",

The percentage of soil pore space filled with water (percent water-filled pores, % WFP), as determined by water content and total porosity, appears to be closely related to soil microbial activity under different tillage regimes. Soil incubated in the laboratory at 60% WFP supported maximum aerobic microbial activity as determined by CO2 production and O2 uptake. In the field, % WFP of surface no-tillage soils (0\u201375 mm) at four U.S. locations averaged 62% at time of sampling, whereas that for plowed soils was 44%. This difference in % WFP was reflected in 3.4 and 9.4 times greater CO2 and N2O production, respectively, from surface no-tillage soils over a 24-h period as compared to plowed soils. At a depth of 75 to 150 mm, % WFP values increased in both no-tillage and plowed soils, averaging approximately 70% for no tillage compared with 50 to 60% for plowed soils. Production of CO2 in the plowed soils was enhanced by the increased % WFP, resulting in little or no difference in CO2 production between tillage treatments. Nitrous oxide production, however, remained greater under no-tillage conditions. Substantially greater amounts of N2O were produced from the N-fertilized soils, regardless of tillage practice. Production of CO2 and N2O was primarily related to the % WFP of tillage treatments although, in several instances, soil-water-soluble C and NO-3 levels were important as well. Calculations of relative aerobic microbial activity between no-tillage and plowed soils, based on differences in % WFP relative to maximum activity at 60%, indicated linear relationships for CO2 and N2O production between WFP values of 30 to 70%.

The approach taken involved a hierarchy of pair-wise class trees where a logic based on vegetation form was applied until all classes were depicted. Multi- temporal AVHRR metrics were used to predict class memberships. Minimum annual red ree ectance, peak annual Normalized Di A erence Vegetation Index (NDVI), and minimum channel three brightness temperature were among the most used metrics.

Mutations at the cleavage sites in APP or in presenilin that increase production or aggregation of A\u03b2 provide a compelling argument for a central role for A\u03b2 aggregation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The progressive accumulation of A\u03b2 aggregates is widely believed to be fundamental to the initial development of neurodegenerative pathology and to trigger a cascade of events such as neurotoxicity, oxidative damage, and inflammation that contribute to the progression of AD (2Pike C.J.

Therefore, many therapeutic efforts are targeted at reducing A\u03b2 production, including inhibiting secretase, increasing A\u03b2 clearance with amyloid vaccines, or blocking A\u03b2 aggregation (with antibodies, peptides, or small organic molecules that selectively bind and inhibit A\u03b2 aggregate and fibril formation). A\u03b2 fibrillization involves formation of dimers and small oligomers followed by growth into protofibrils and fibrils via a complex multistep-nucleated polymerization. Polymerizing A\u03b2 fibrils and intermediates can be stained by amyloidophilic dyes such as Congo Red (CR) (6Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem.

However, CR is toxic and negatively charged and therefore poorly brain-penetrant (10Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Pettegrew J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Curcumin (diferulomethane) is a low molecular weight molecule with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities that has a favorable toxicity profile and is under development as a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent (11Kelloff G.J.

Our previous results demonstrated that chronic dietary curcumin lowered A\u03b2 deposition in 16-month-old APPsw transgenic mice (Tg2576) (12Lim G.P. Chu T. Yang F. Beech W. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8370-8377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unresolved whether curcumin was reducing plaques in vivo in part by effects on aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1, curcumin has a structure similar to Congo Red but with the charge replaced by polar groups like the brain-permeable compound chrysamine G (10Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Pettegrew J.W.

It is also similar to RS-0406, a novel compound selected from a screen of 113,000 compounds as a potent inhibitor of A\u03b2 oligomer formation (14Nakagami Y. Nishimura S. Murasugi T. Kaneko I. Meguro M. Marumoto S.K.H. Koyama K. Oda T. Br. J. Pharamacol. 2002; 137: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, like these polar A\u03b2 binding compounds, curcumin might be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to amyloid and related aggregates. Therefore, in these studies, we used an in vitro model of A\u03b2 fibrillization to show that curcumin can bind amyloid to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation as well as fibril and oligomer formation with dosing at achievable levels. We also demonstrate that curcumin can label plaques in vitro and in vivo, block toxicity of oligomers in vitro, and significantly reduce amyloid levels in aged Tg2576 mice (22 months old) fed a curcumin diet beginning at 17 months after established amyloid deposition.

A\u03b2 fragment peptides 1\u201313, 1\u201328, 25\u201335, 34\u201340, and 37\u201342 were purchased from Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX), and A\u03b2 12\u201328 was purchased from American Peptide Company. A\u03b2 8\u201317, 14\u201324, 17\u201324, and 17\u201328 were purchased from Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Curcumin, naproxen, and ibuprofen were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Stocks of curcumin, naproxen, and ibuprofen (5 mm) were dissolved in 100% ethanol and stored at -80 \u00b0C. A 5 mm stock of Congo Red was prepared in dH2O immediately before use. The 6E10 antibody (A\u03b2 1\u201317) was purchased from Signet Labs, and the A11 antibody was generously provided by C. Glabe (University of California, Irvine). All other reagents were from Sigma. Just before use, curcumin was diluted from 2.5 mm to 50 nm in 0.1 m TBS (pH 7.4) containing 3% BSA with 0.5% Tween 20. Thioflavin S (1%) was freshly prepared in dH2O, stirred for 0.5 h, and filtered. Human AD hippocampus was fixed in buffered formalin and snap-frozen. Tg2576 mice (22 months old) were perfused with Hepes buffer and protease inhibitors (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and brains were removed, fixed in buffered formalin, and snap-frozen. Both brains were cryosectioned at 12 \u03bcm and stored at -70 \u00b0C. Sections were warmed to room temperature for 10 min and dipped in 75% ethanol, treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m TBS (pH 7.4) containing 3% BSA with 0.5% Tween 20 for 10 min each. Different concentrations of curcumin were applied to sections for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber. Sections were washed in TBS three times, rinsed once in dH2O, and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting medium. Adjacent sections were stained with 1% thioflavin S for 10 min at room temperature and dipped for 1 min in 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 75% ethanol before rinsing in dH2O. All sections were examined and photographed with a fluorescence microscope using fluorescein isothiocyanate optics. Groups of APPsw Tg2576 transgenic mice raised on Purina 5015 breeder chow were placed on 500 ppm curcumin (Sabinsa, Piscataway, NJ) or control safflower oil-based test diets (TD#02347 and TD#02346, respectively; Harlan Teklad) and aged until 22 months. A curcumin stock solution was diluted 1:100 into sterile PBS. Three 22-month-old Tg2576 mice (50 g body weight) were anesthetized with 25 mg\/ml nembutal (intraperitoneally). One mouse on the chronic 500 ppm curcumin diet was injected with 200 \u03bcl of curcumin\/PBS into the right carotid artery over a 5-min period. Because blood volume for a 50-g mouse was estimated to be about 4 ml (80 ml\/kg \u00d7 0.05 kg), we expected blood levels of curcumin to reach \u223c2 \u03bcm. The other two mice were injected with PBS only as a control, and one of these mice had also received the 500-ppm curcumin diet. After 1 h, the mice were perfused as described previously (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brains were removed and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane chilled by liquid nitrogen. Freshly cut cryosections (12 \u03bcm) were air-dried for 10 min in the dark and coverslipped with VECTASHIELD mounting medium for fluorescence protection (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined and photographed with a Nikon Microphot-Fx fluorescence microscope using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Image Analysis of Plaque Pathology\u2014Plaque burden was assessed using a characterized polyclonal antibody against A\u03b2 1\u201313 (DAE) (15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coronal sections were made through anterior (bregma; -1.00 to -1.46 mm), middle (bregma; -1.58 to -2.30 mm), and posterior hippocampus (bregma; -2.46 to -3.16 mm) of control (n = 6) and curcumin-treated mice (n = 8). Immunolabeling was examined in various cortical and hippocampal areas of animals, and image analysis was performed as described previously (12Lim G.P. Chu T. Yang F. Beech W. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8370-8377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Hsiao Ashe K. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amyloid Extracts and Assays\u2014Amyloid levels were evaluated in the cortex of control (n = 6) and curcumin-fed (n = 4) Tg2576 mice. Samples were processed in TBS and lysis buffer (detergent) as described previously (16Calon F. Lim G.P. Yang F. Morihara T. Teter B. Ubeda O. Rostaing P. Triller A. Salem Jr., N. Ashe K.H. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 633-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble pellets from cortex were sonicated in 8 volumes of 5 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris-HCl and solubilized by agitation at room temperature for 3\u20134 h. Guanidine-soluble extracts were diluted 1:10,000 with TBS containing 5% BSA and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and assayed for total A\u03b2 by ELISA as described previously (17Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Aggregation\u2014A\u03b240 was dissolved at 1 mg\/ml in dH2O, and curcumin stock was diluted in 0.1 m TBS with 0.02% Tween 20. A\u03b240 (100 \u03bcg\/ml) was mixed a 1:1 volume ratio with curcumin in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 6 days at 37 \u00b0C. Final concentrations of A\u03b240 were 50 \u03bcg\/ml (11.6 \u03bcm), and curcumin concentrations were 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 \u03bcm. Disaggregation of Preformed Fibrils\u2014A\u03b240 (100 \u03bcg\/ml) was incubated for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C to generate fibrils. Preformed fibrils were mixed with the same concentrations of curcumin as above for an additional 3 days at 37 \u00b0C. At the end of both incubations, an aliquot (3 \u03bcl) was taken from each tube for electron microscopy (EM) analysis. The remaining A\u03b2 solution was assayed for aggregates using the 6E10\/6E10 sandwich ELISA. 6E10\/6E10 Aggregation ELISA\u2014To determine the relative amount of aggregated A\u03b2, the monoclonal antibody 6E10 was used for both detection and capture as described by Howlett et al. (17Howlett D.R. Perry A.E. Godfrey F. Swatton J.E. Jennings K.H. Spitzfaden C. Wadsworth H. Wood S.J. Markwell R.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 3 \u03bcg\/ml 6E10 in 55 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9) at 4 \u00b0C overnight before wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with TBS-Tween 20 (TBS-T; 0.1 m TBS, pH 7.4, 0.02% Tween 20) with 1% BSA. Samples were transferred to the wells, and plates were placed on an orbital shaker (30 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing four times with TBS-T, biotinylated 6E10 antibody diluted 1:1200 in TBS-T containing 1% BSA was applied to the plate for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. After washing, alkaline phosphatase streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted at 1:4000 in TBS-T with 1% BSA was applied to the plates, followed by the addition of the fluorescent substrate, Attophos (Promega). Fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor II fluorescence plate reader (excitation 450 nm and emission 580 nm; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A\u03b2 1\u201340 was dissolved at 1 mg\/ml in dH2O. A 50 \u03bcg\/ml solution was made with 0, 0.5, 2, or 8 \u03bcm curcumin. Naproxen and ibuprofen were tested at 0, 8, 16, and 32 \u03bcm. Samples were sealed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 6 days at 37 \u00b0C. A\u03b2 aggregates were assayed with the 6E10\/6E10 ELISA as above. Separate drug-only controls were used to assess possible drug fluorescence interference in the assay. EM was used to observe inhibition of A\u03b2 fibril formation in disaggregation and aggregation inhibition experiments (see Fig. 5). To determine whether filaments had formed, 3 \u03bcl of A\u03b2 peptide solution was applied to 150-mesh copper grids coated with Formvar\/carbon film (EM Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) for 30 s. Excess solution on the other side of grids was absorbed with filter paper, grids were stained with one drop of 0.5% filtered uranyl acetate for 20 s, and staining solution was absorbed with filter paper again. After air drying for 4 h or overnight, grids were examined with an electron microscope (TECNAI 10\/12; Phillips) at 80 kV. A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were solubilized in HFIP, dried overnight at room temperature and speed-vacuumed for 10 min (18Chromy B.A. Nowak R.J. Lambert M.P. Viola K.L. Chang L. Velasco P.T. Jones B.W. Fernandez S.J. Lacor P.N. Horowitz P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12749-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at -80 \u00b0C until they were needed, when they were resolubilized in 20 \u03bcl of Me2SO and dissolved in dH2O (1 mg\/ml). Additional samples of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and shorter A\u03b2 peptides were dissolved in dH2O, whereas A\u03b2 17\u201324 was dissolved in Me2SO. Peptides were aggregated in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3) at 500 \u03bcg\/ml. Two hundred \u03bcl of each peptide solution was sealed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated without shaking at 37 \u00b0C for 10 days. After 10 days, an aliquot was removed for EM analysis of structure before solutions from each tube were mixed with curcumin at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcm. Samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then spun at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. To assess curcumin staining of synthetic peptide aggregates, pellets were mixed with 10 \u03bcl of dH2O, smeared to slides, and air-dried for 1 h. Supernatant, spun down after mixing A\u03b2 peptides with 1 \u03bcm curcumin, were applied to cryosections of Tg2576 mouse brain (22 months) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Slides were coverslipped with anti-quenching mounting medium before examination under a fluorescent microscope (Table I).Table ICurcumin binds to peptide sequences that form fibrils or protofibrils Shown are a schematic diagram and table of curcumin binding experiments. A\u03b2 was aggregated for 10 days at 37 \u00b0C before an aliquot was removed for EM analysis. Curcumin was incubated with samples before they were centrifuged. Pellets were smeared on glass slides to check for A\u03b2 binding while supernatants were applied to Tg2576 mouse brain sections for plaque labeling. Weak staining was defined as + or ++, and strong staining was +++ or ++++. Fibrils\/protofibrils were determined by estimating thickness and length of fibers. Open table in a new tab Immunoblot of Curcumin- and Congo Red-treated A\u03b242 Oligomers\u2014An aliquot of A\u03b242 (0.045 mg) was dissolved in 20 \u03bclofMe2SO and diluted in Ham's F-12 media without phenol red (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). A\u03b242 (5 \u03bcm) was incubated with curcumin (0, 0.25, 1, 4, 16, and 64 \u03bcm) or Congo Red (16 and 64 \u03bcm) in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 4 h. After the incubation, the samples (72 \u03bcl) were spun at 14,000 \u00d7 g (4 \u00b0C for 10 min), and the supernatant (65 \u03bcl) was mixed with an equal part of Tricine sample buffer without reducing agents (Bio-Rad). The unaggregated A\u03b242 control was not incubated at 37 \u00b0C, and after dilution in F-12 medium, it was mixed with sample buffer (no centrifuging) and stored at -20 \u00b0C before it was electrophoresed. Samples (30 \u03bcl, no boiling) were electrophoresed at 100 V on a 10\u201320% Tris-Tricine SDS gel, transferred at 100 V for 1 h, and blocked overnight (4 \u00b0C) with 10% nonfat milk in PBS plus 0.1% gelatin. The blots were probed with 6E10 (1:2000; 3 h at room temperature), followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; 1 h at room temperature), and developed with ECL. Dot Blot Assay\u2014A\u03b240 oligomer was prepared from HFIP-solubilized A\u03b2 (4 mg\/ml, 10\u201320 min in HFIP at 25 \u00b0C). An 80-\u03bcl A\u03b2 aliquot was diluted 1:10 with 800 \u03bcl of sterile H2O. The final A\u03b2 concentration was 400 \u03bcg\/ml or 88 \u03bcm. Curcumin was added to A\u03b2 solutions to give final 0, 2, and 16 \u03bcm curcumin in 0.01% methanol. After the pH was adjusted (pH 3), the samples were incubated for 2.5 h at 42 \u00b0C followed by a 48-h incubation at room temperature with stirring. Samples (500 ng of oligomer) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h, washed with TBS-T, and probed with anti-oligomer A11 antibody (19Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) solution (1:10,000) or 6E10 (1: 10,000) in 3% BSA-TBS-T overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing, it was probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase- or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce) solution (1:12,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed with SuperSignal (Pierce) for 2\u20135 min. Dots were scanned and analyzed with a model GS-700 densitometer using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Toxicity Assays\u2014Confirmation of A\u03b2 oligomer toxicity was performed in human APPSwe neuroblastoma (N2a) cells, which were cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum, 200 \u03bcg\/ml Glutamax. Cells were plated at equal densities (8000 cells\/well) with 1.5% bovine calf serum and maintained at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was removed before treatment and replaced with medium containing 70% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Opti-MEM with 0.1% BSA. An LDH assay was performed on media using the LDH assay toxicity kit (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine whether curcumin could block this oligomer toxicity, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown and maintained as described previously (20Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Vinters H.V. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 10,000 cells\/well in 96-well plates and were differentiated in low serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with N2 supplement and 1 \u00d7 10-5m all-trans-retinoic acid for 7 days. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh maintenance medium containing 0.1% BSA. A\u03b242 oligomer (100 nm) was added to cells for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C with or without 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcm curcumin. After treatment, LDH assay was performed as mentioned above. Cell viability was assayed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay (21Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46517) Google Scholar), where absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Each data point was determined in triplicate, and the S.D. value did not exceed 5%. Because curcumin is a fluorochrome, we first compared plaque-associated curcumin fluorescence with that of thioflavin S, using sections from APPsw (Tg2576) mouse brain (Fig. 2, A, B, and E) and AD hippocampus (Fig. 2, C and D). Like thioflavin S (Fig. 2, A and C), curcumin brightly labeled amyloid plaques (1 \u03bcm; Fig. 2, B\u2013E). In AD brain, curcumin labeled plaques with a yellow fluorescence (Fig. 2D) similar to thioflavin S in an adjacent section (Fig. 2C). Thioflavin S labeled tangles very strongly (Fig. 2C), whereas curcumin labeled tangles only weakly or not at all (Fig. 2D). Curcumin fluorescence was initially yellow-orange, but with prolonged (>2-min) light exposure, the fluorescence gradually shifted to yellow\/green fluorescence. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2E, where the right side of the field was illuminated for 3 min before shifting the field back to make the photoexposure. Color change depended on the intensity of plaque staining and the fluorescent exposure time, and was stable for several weeks at 4 \u00b0C. Lipofuscin age pigments in this aged mouse brain (small arrows) are orange\/red under these thioflavin optics and, unlike curcumin labeling, did not show a fluorescent shift with prolonged illumination. Optimal staining concentrations for curcumin were 0.5\u20132 \u03bcm. Unlike thioflavin S and Congo Red, curcumin is highly hydrophobic and should readily enter the brain to bind to plaques in vivo. In order to evaluate this idea, we injected curcumin (50 \u03bcm in 200 \u03bcl) or vehicle (PBS) into the carotid artery of aged Tg2576 mice. Mice were sacrificed 1 h later, and unfixed cryosections were immediately prepared from snap-frozen brains. Untreated mice injected with PBS only showed no plaque staining (Fig. 3A), but a mouse on a chronic curcumin diet (500 ppm) showed discernable but weak plaque staining when injected with PBS alone (Fig. 3B). Plaques in the curcumin-injected mouse were brightly labeled (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggested that curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to plaques in transgenic mice after oral feeding or peripheral injection. Having established that curcumin can stain in vitro and in vivo amyloid, we sought to test whether it can interfere with A\u03b2 aggregation and its disaggregation. Because curcumin fluoresces over the same wavelengths as thioflavin S, we could not use thioflavin-based assays to quantify amyloid fibrils in curcumin-treated samples, and thioflavin-based assays require high concentrations of A\u03b2. Therefore, we employed a sandwich ELISA for aggregated A\u03b2 using the same N-terminal A\u03b2 antibody (6E10) for both capture and detection. A\u03b240 (final concentration 50 \u03bcg\/ml) was incubated under fibril-forming conditions with 0\u20138 \u03bcm curcumin. As shown in Fig. 4A, A\u03b2 aggregation was significantly inhibited with increasing doses of curcumin, with an approximate IC50 of 0.81 \u03bcm (gray circles; p < 0.001). When A\u03b2 was preaggregated for 3 days before incubation with curcumin, increasing doses of curcumin were capable of inducing the disaggregation of preaggregated A\u03b240, with an IC50 of 1 \u03bcm (filled circles; p < 0.005; Fig. 4B). In control experiments, curcumin over this range did not interfere with the A\u03b2 aggregate ELISA and did not interfere with an ELISA with 6E10 as the capture and anti-A\u03b2 34\u201340 as the detection (not shown), implying that curcumin did not simply block 6E10 antibody binding. We also sought to test whether curcumin was better than other NSAIDs at inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation. A\u03b240 (final concentration 50 \u03bcg\/ml) was incubated with curcumin (0\u20138 \u03bcm), naproxen (0\u201332 \u03bcm), or ibuprofen (0\u201332 \u03bcm) for 6 days at 37 \u00b0C. The presence of A\u03b2 aggregates was determined with the 6E10\/6E10 ELISA. In this assay, curcumin again showed dose-dependent inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregate formation over the low dose range (Fig. 4C), in contrast to naproxen and ibuprofen (Fig. 4, D and E). These data indicate that although high concentrations of naproxen and ibuprofen can inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation (20Yang F. Sun X. Beech W. Teter B. Wu S. Sigel J. Vinters H.V. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar), curcumin is a better aggregation inhibitor. EM Analysis of Inhibition of Fibril Formation\u2014To determine whether curcumin could inhibit the formation of fibrils, EM was used to examine samples of A\u03b240 incubated with and without curcumin as described under \u201cExperimental Procedures.\u201d A\u03b240 (50 \u03bcg\/ml) incubated for 6 days at 37 \u00b0C formed extensive, but less mature fibrils (Fig. 5A) than fibrils formed with a higher concentration of A\u03b240 (100 \u03bcg\/ml; Fig. 5D). These fibrils were extensive and more uniform in thickness than those at the lower concentration, with less branching, bumps, or nodules. In order to test whether low physiologically relevant concentrations of curcumin might inhibit fibril formation, we tested curcumin's impact on A\u03b2 assembly at the lower A\u03b240 (50 \u03bcg\/ml) concentration. If a low dose of curcumin (0.125 \u03bcm) was included in the initial incubation, fibril formation appeared reduced (Fig. 5B). A higher dose (2 \u03bcm) resulted in similar but more potent inhibition of fibril formation (Fig. 5C). Droplets of curcumin\/Tween accumulated with curcumin dose as fibril formation was inhibited. In order to determine whether curcumin could also be inhibitory when added after initial aggregation events, we incubated 100 \u03bcg\/ml A\u03b240 for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C and then incubated another 3 days at 37 \u00b0C without (Fig. 5D) or with 0.125 \u03bcm (Fig. 5E) and 2 \u03bcm curcumin (Fig. 5F). The results show that curcumin limits fibril formation even when added midway through the incubation, consistent with an impact on fibril maturation or dissolution. Curcumin Prevents Formation of Oligomers\u2014Soluble oligomers of A\u03b2 or \u201cADDLs\u201d are a neurotoxic species implicated in AD pathogenesis (22Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V.

In this paper, the use of nanostructured anode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is reviewed. Nanostructured materials such as nano-carbons, alloys, metal oxides, and metal sulfides\/nitrides have been used as anodes for next-generation LIBs with high reversible capacity, fast power capability, good safety, and long cycle life. This is due to their relatively short mass and charge pathways, high transport rates of both lithium ions and electrons, and other extremely charming surface activities. In this review paper, the effect of the nanostructure on the electrochemical performance of these anodes is presented. Their synthesis processes, electrochemical properties, and electrode reaction mechanisms are also discussed. The major goals of this review are to give a broad overview of recent scientific researches and developments of anode materials using novel nanoscience and nanotechnology and to highlight new progresses in using these nanostructured materials to develop high-performance LIBs.

    "text":"Defining the core Arabidopsis thaliana root microbiome. Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria.

The current planetary crisis of climate change or global warming elicits a variety of responses in individuals, groups, and governments, ranging from denial, disconnect, and indifference to a spirit of engagement and activism of varying kinds and degrees. These responses saturate our sense of the now. Alan Weisman\u2019s best-selling book The World without Us suggests a thought experiment as a way of experiencing our present: \u201cSuppose that the worst has happened. Human extinction is a fait accompli. . . . Picture a world from which we all suddenly vanished. . . . Might we have left some faint, enduring mark on the universe? . . . Is it possible that, instead of heaving a huge biological sigh of relief, the world without us would miss us?\u201d1 I am drawn to Weisman\u2019s experiment as it tellingly demonstrates how the current crisis can precipitate a sense of the present that disconnects the future from the past by putting such a future beyond the grasp of historical sensibility. The discipline of history exists on the assumption that our past, present, and future are connected by a certain continuity of human experience. We normally envisage the future with the help of the same faculty that allows us to picture the past.

Nitrification, the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate, occurs in a wide variety of environments and plays a central role in the global nitrogen cycle. Catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, the ability to oxidize ammonia was previously thought to be restricted to a few groups within the \u03b2- and \u03b3- Proteobacteria . However, recent metagenomic studies have revealed the existence of unique ammonia monooxygenase \u03b1-subunit (amoA) genes derived from uncultivated, nonextremophilic Crenarchaeota. Here, we report molecular evidence for the widespread presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in marine water columns and sediments. Using PCR primers designed to specifically target archaeal amoA , we find AOA to be pervasive in areas of the ocean that are critical for the global nitrogen cycle, including the base of the euphotic zone, suboxic water columns, and estuarine and coastal sediments. Diverse and distinct AOA communities are associated with each of these habitats, with little overlap between water columns and sediments. Within marine sediments, most AOA sequences are unique to individual sampling locations, whereas a small number of sequences are evidently cosmopolitan in distribution. Considering the abundance of nonextremophilic archaea in the ocean, our results suggest that AOA may play a significant, but previously unrecognized, role in the global nitrogen cycle.",

This review describes the sources, fate, and transport of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in the environment, with a specific focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFO). The global historical industry-wide emissions of total PFCAs from direct (manufacture, use, consumer products) and indirect (PFCA impurities and\/or precursors) sources were estimated to be 3200\u22127300 tonnes. It was estimated that the majority (\u223c80%) of PFCAs have been released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. Although indirect sources were estimated to be much less important than direct sources, there were larger uncertainties associated with the calculations for indirect sources. The physical\u2212chemical properties of PFO (negligible vapor pressure, high solubility in water, and moderate sorption to solids) suggested that PFO would accumulate in surface waters. Estimated mass inventories of PFO in various environmental compartments confirmed that surface waters, especially oceans, contain the majority of PFO. The only environmental sinks for PFO were identified to be sediment burial and transport to the deep oceans, implying a long environmental residence time. Transport pathways for PFCAs in the environment were reviewed, and it was concluded that, in addition to atmospheric transport\/degradation of precursors, atmospheric and ocean water transport of the PFCAs themselves could significantly contribute to their long-range transport. It was estimated that 2\u221212 tonnes\/year of PFO are transported to the Artic by oceanic transport, which is greater than the amount estimated to result from atmospheric transport\/degradation of precursors.",

The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that scholars can make simple, predictive models of social\u2013ecological systems (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear, cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested, multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses of how attributes of ( i ) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing area), ( ii ) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish, water, fodder), ( iii ) the users of that system, and ( iv ) the governance system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones.

    "text":"Metagenomics: Application of Genomics to Uncultured Microorganisms. SUMMARY Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na + (Li + )\/H + antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.",

We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called \u2018microbial dark matter\u2019. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20% of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet. Uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells of major uncharted branches of the tree of life are targeted and sequenced using single-cell genomics; this enables resolution of many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships, uncovers unexpected metabolic features that challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life, and leads to the proposal of two new superphyla.

A detailed investigation has been carried out of the structure and electrochemical activity of electrodeposited Ni-Fe films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Ni-Fe films with a bulk and surface composition of 40% Fe exhibit OER activities that are roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a freshly deposited Ni film and about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of an Fe film. The freshly deposited Ni film increases in activity by as much as 20-fold during exposure to the electrolyte (KOH); however, all films containing Fe are stable as deposited. The oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH in Ni films occurs at potentials below the onset of the OER. Incorporation of Fe into the film increases the potential at which Ni(OH)2\/NiOOH redox occurs and decreases the average oxidation state of Ni in NiOOH. The Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) and reaction order in OH(-) (1) for the mixed Ni-Fe films (containing up to 95% Fe) are the same as those for aged Ni films. In situ Raman spectra acquired in 0.1 M KOH at OER potentials show two bands characteristic of NiOOH. The relative intensities of these bands vary with Fe content, indicating a change in the local environment of Ni-O. Similar changes in the relative intensities of the bands and an increase in OER activity are observed when pure Ni films are aged. These observations suggest that the OER is catalyzed by Ni in Ni-Fe films and that the presence of Fe alters the redox properties of Ni, causing a positive shift in the potential at which Ni(OH)2\/NiOOH redox occurs, a decrease in the average oxidation state of the Ni sites, and a concurrent increase in the activity of Ni cations for the OER.",

Background Interest in photochemical synthesis has been motivated in part by the realization that sunlight is effectively an inexhaustible energy source.Chemists have also long recognized distinctive patterns of reactivity that are uniquely accessible via photochemical activation. However, most simple organic molecules absorb only ultraviolet (UV) light and cannot be activated by the visible wavelengths that comprise most of the solar energy that reaches Earth\u2019s surface. Consequently, organic photochemistry has generally required the use of UV light sources. Advances Over the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in synthetic photochemistry, based on the recognition that the transition metal chromophores that have been so productively exploited in the design of technologies for solar energy conversion can also convert visible light energy into useful chemical potential for synthetic purposes. Visible light enables productive photoreactions of compounds possessing weak bonds that are sensitive toward UV photodegradation. Furthermore, visible light photoreactions can be conducted by using essentially any source of white light, including sunlight, which obviates the need for specialized UV photoreactors. This feature has expanded the accessibility of photochemical reactions to a broader range of synthetic organic chemists. A variety of reaction types have now been shown to be amenable to visible light photocatalysis via photoinduced electron transfer to or from the transition metal chromophore, as well as energy-transfer processes. The predictable reactivity of the intermediates generated and the tolerance of the reaction conditions to a wide range of functional groups have enabled the application of these reactions to the synthesis of increasingly complex target molecules. Outlook This general strategy for the use of visible light in organic synthesis is already being adopted by a growing community of synthetic chemists. Much of the current research in this emerging area is geared toward the discovery of photochemical solutions for increasingly ambitious synthetic goals. Visible light photocatalysis is also attracting the attention of researchers in chemical biology, materials science, and drug discovery, who recognize that these reactions offer opportunities for innovation in areas beyond traditional organic synthesis. The long-term goals of this emerging area are to continue to improve efficiency and synthetic utility and to realize the long-standing goal of performing chemical synthesis using the sun.",

It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramelan (Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars.",

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability.

However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health.

There is growing concern that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global climate change. Therefore, it is critical to develop technologies to mitigate this problem. One very promising approach to reducing CO2 emissions is CO2 capture at a power plant, transport to an injection site, and sequestration for long-term storage in any of a variety of suitable geologic formations. However, if the promise of this approach is to come to fruition, capture costs will have to be reduced. The Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program is actively pursuing this goal. CO2 capture from coal-derived power generation can be achieved by various approaches: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. All three of these pathways are under investigation, some at an early stage of development. A wide variety of separation techniques is being pursued, including gas phase separation, absorption into a liquid, and adsorption on a solid, as well as hybrid processes, such as adsorption\/membrane systems.

Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management.

The small GTPases Rab27a and Rab27b and their effectors, Slp4 and Slac2b, control exosome secretion at different steps by regulating the peripheral localization, retention and docking of exosomal precursors, the multivesicular endosomes. Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles that share structural and biochemical characteristics with intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). Exosomes could be involved in intercellular communication and in the pathogenesis of infectious and degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion are, however, poorly understood. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified five Rab GTPases that promote exosome secretion in HeLa cells. Among these, Rab27a and Rab27b were found to function in MVE docking at the plasma membrane. The size of MVEs was strongly increased by Rab27a silencing, whereas MVEs were redistributed towards the perinuclear region upon Rab27b silencing. Thus, the two Rab27 isoforms have different roles in the exosomal pathway. In addition, silencing two known Rab27 effectors, Slp4 (also known as SYTL4, synaptotagmin-like 4) and Slac2b (also known as EXPH5, exophilin 5), inhibited exosome secretion and phenocopied silencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively.

In this study, we have further improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a, hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2) calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4) improving estimates of stomatal conductance, aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance; 5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6) dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy flux towers. The global annual total ET over the vegetated land surface is 62.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 \u00a0km 3 , agrees very well with other reported estimates of 65.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 \u00a0km 3 over the terrestrial land surface, which is much higher than 45.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 \u00a0km 3 estimated with the old algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE) of daily ET from 0.39\u00a0mm day \u22121 to 0.33\u00a0mm\u00a0day \u22121 driven by tower meteorological data, and from 0.40\u00a0mm\u00a0day \u22121 to 0.31\u00a0mm\u00a0day \u22121 driven by GMAO data, a global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6% and 24.1% of the ET measured from towers, within the range (10\u201330%) of the reported uncertainties in ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the skill score with tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from 0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET. Based on these results, the improved ET algorithm has a better performance in generating global ET data products, providing critical information on global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes.",

The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4\u20103.8 Pg C y \u20101 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7\u20108.6 Pg C y \u20101 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6\u2010 3.0 Pg C y \u20101 ) and a century later (0.3\u20106.6 Pg C y \u20101 ) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the \u2018diminishing return\u2019 of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate",

Triangular silver nanoparticles ( approximately 100 nm wide and 50 nm high) have remarkable optical properties. In particular, the peak extinction wavelength, lambda(max) of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum is unexpectedly sensitive to nanoparticle size, shape, and local ( approximately 10-30 nm) external dielectric environment. This sensitivity of the LSPR lambda(max) to the nanoenvironment has allowed us to develop a new class of nanoscale affinity biosensors. The essential characteristics and operational principles of these LSPR nanobiosensors will be illustrated using the well-studied biotin-streptavidin system. Exposure of biotin-functionalized Ag nanotriangles to 100 nM streptavidin (SA) caused a 27.0 nm red-shift in the LSPR lambda(max). The LSPR lambda(max) shift, DeltaR\/DeltaR(max), versus [SA] response curve was measured over the concentration range 10(-)(15) M < [SA] < 10(-)(6) M. Comparison of the data with the theoretical normalized response expected for 1:1 binding of a ligand to a multivalent receptor with different sites but invariant affinities yielded approximate values for the saturation response, DeltaR(max) = 26.5 nm, and the surface-confined thermodynamic binding constant K(a,surf) = 10(11) M(-)(1). At present, the limit of detection (LOD) for the LSPR nanobiosensor is found to be in the low-picomolar to high-femtomolar region. A strategy to amplify the response of the LSPR nanobiosensor using biotinylated Au colloids and thereby further improve the LOD is demonstrated. Several control experiments were performed to define the LSPR nanobiosensor's response to nonspecific binding as well as to demonstrate its response to the specific binding of another protein. These include the following: (1) electrostatic binding of SA to a nonbiotinylated surface, (2) nonspecific interactions of prebiotinylated SA to a biotinylated surface, (3) nonspecific interactions of bovine serum albumin to a biotinylated surface, and (4) specific binding of anti-biotin to a biotinylated surface. The LSPR nanobiosensor provides a pathway to ultrasensitive biodetection experiments with extremely simple, small, light, robust, low-cost instrumentation that will greatly facilitate field-portable environmental or point-of-service medical diagnostic applications.",

We present and discuss a new dataset of gridded emissions covering the historical period (1850\u20132000) in decadal increments at a horizontal resolution of 0.5\u00b0 in latitude and longitude. The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations.",

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe3+ in Ni1\u2013xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe\u2013O bond distances, induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods, we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites. By contrast, Ni sites in Ni1\u2013xFexOOH are not active sites for the oxidation of water.",

    "text":"The role of renewable energy in the global energy transformation. This paper explores the technical and economic characteristics of an accelerated energy transition to 2050, using new datasets for renewable energy. The analysis indicates that energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are the core elements of that transition, and their synergies are likewise important. Favourable economics, ubiquitous resources, scalable technology, and significant socio-economic benefits underpin such a transition. Renewable energy can supply two-thirds of the total global energy demand, and contribute to the bulk of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is needed between now and 2050 for limiting average global surface temperature increase below 2 \u00b0C. Enabling policy and regulatory frameworks will need to be adjusted to mobilise the six-fold acceleration of renewables growth that is needed, with the highest growth estimated for wind and solar PV technologies, complemented by a high level of energy efficiency. Still, to ensure the eventual elimination of carbon dioxide emissions will require new technology and innovation, notably for the transport and manufacturing sectors, which remain largely ignored in the international debate. More attention is needed for emerging infrastructure issues such as charging infrastructure and other sector coupling implications.",

The authors describe the construction of a 0.58 lat\u2010long gridded dataset of monthly terrestrial surface climate for the period of 1901\u201096. The dataset comprises a suite of seven climate elements: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapor pressure, cloud cover, and ground frost frequency. The spatial coverage extends over all land areas, including oceanic islands but excluding Antarctica. Fields of monthly climate anomalies, relative to the 1961\u201090 mean, were interpolated from surface climate data. The anomaly grids were then combined with a 1961\u201090 mean monthly climatology (described in Part I) to arrive at grids of monthly climate over the 96-yr period. The primary variables\u2014precipitation, mean temperature, and diurnal temperature range\u2014were interpolated directly from station observations. The resulting time series are compared with other coarser-resolution datasets of similar temporal extent. The remaining climatic elements, termed secondary variables,were interpolated from merged datasets comprising station observations and, in regions where there were no station data, synthetic data estimated using predictive relationships with the primary variables. These predictive relationships are described and evaluated. It is argued that this new dataset represents an advance over other products because (i) it has higher spatial resolution than other datasets of similar temporal extent, (ii) it has longer temporal coverage than other products of similar spatial resolution, (iii) it encompasses a more extensive suite of surface climate variables than available elsewhere, and (iv) the construction method ensures that strict temporal fidelity is maintained. The dataset should be of particular relevance to a number of applications in applied climatology, including large-scale biogeochemical and hydrological modeling, climate change scenario construction, evaluation of regional climate models, and comparison with satellite products. The dataset is available from the Climatic Research Unit and is currently being updated to 1998.",

A new inventory of air pollutant emissions in Asia in the year 2006 is developed to support the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-Phase B (INTEX-B) funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Emissions are estimated for all major anthropogenic sources, excluding biomass burning. We estimate total Asian anthropogenic emissions in the year 2006 as follows: 47.1 Tg SO2, 36.7 Tg NOx, 298.2 Tg CO, 54.6 Tg NMVOC, 29.2 Tg PM10, 22.2 Tg PM2.5, 2.97 Tg BC, and 6.57 Tg OC. We emphasize emissions from China because they dominate the Asia pollutant outflow to the Pacific and the increase of emissions from China since 2000 is of great concern. We have implemented a series of improved methodologies to gain a better understanding of emissions from China, including a detailed technology-based approach, a dynamic methodology representing rapid technology renewal, critical examination of energy statistics, and a new scheme of NMVOC speciation for model-ready emissions. We estimate China's anthropogenic emissions in the year 2006 to be as follows: 31.0 Tg SO2, 20.8 Tg NOx, 166.9 Tg CO, 23.2 Tg NMVOC, 18.2 Tg PM10, 13.3 Tg PM2.5, 1.8 Tg BC, and 3.2 Tg OC. We have also estimated 2001 emissions for China using the same methodology and found that all species show an increasing trend during 2001\u20132006: 36% increase for SO2, 55% for NOx, 18% for CO, 29% for VOC, 13% for PM10, and 14% for PM2.5, BC, and OC.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor consisting of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta subunits. HIF-1 alpha expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity increase exponentially as cellular O2 concentration is decreased. Several dozen target genes that are transactivated by HIF-1 have been identified, including those encoding erythropoietin, glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and vascular endothelial growth factor. The products of these genes either increase O2 delivery or allow metabolic adaptation to reduced O2 availability. HIF-1 is required for cardiac and vascular development and embryonic survival. In fetal and postnatal life, HIF-1 is required for a variety of physiological responses to chronic hypoxia. HIF-1 expression is increased in tumor cells by multiple mechanisms and may mediate adaptation to hypoxia that is critical for tumor progression. HIF-1 thus appears to function as a master regulator of O2 homeostasis that plays essential roles in cellular and systemic physiology, development, and pathophysiology.",

Caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin D, previously shown to mediate pyroptosis, acts by inducing oligomerization and pore formation in cell membranes. Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is part of the innate immune response, is triggered by caspase-mediated cleavage of the inflammasome protein gasdermin D. Judy Lieberman and colleagues examine the underlying molecular mechanism for gasdermin functioning in pyroptosis. They present evidence that caspase 11 cleavage of gasdermin D, previously shown to mediate pyroptosis, induces oligomerization of the N-terminal domain and pore formation. Also in this issue of Nature, Feng Shao and colleagues show that the N-terminal domains of gasdermins D, A and A3 are cytotoxic because they disrupt cell membranes in both mammalian cells and artificially transformed bacteria through the formation of membrane pores. Inflammatory caspases (caspases 1, 4, 5 and 11) are activated in response to microbial infection and danger signals. When activated, they cleave mouse and human gasdermin D (GSDMD) after Asp276 and Asp275, respectively, to generate an N-terminal cleavage product (GSDMD-NT) that triggers inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b21,2. Cleavage removes the C-terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT), which is thought to fold back on GSDMD-NT to inhibit its activation. However, how GSDMD-NT causes cell death is unknown. Here we show that GSDMD-NT oligomerizes in membranes to form pores that are visible by electron microscopy. GSDMD-NT binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates and phosphatidylserine (restricted to the cell membrane inner leaflet) and cardiolipin (present in the inner and outer leaflets of bacterial membranes). Mutation of four evolutionarily conserved basic residues blocks GSDMD-NT oligomerization, membrane binding, pore formation and pyroptosis. Because of its lipid-binding preferences, GSDMD-NT kills from within the cell, but does not harm neighbouring mammalian cells when it is released during pyroptosis. GSDMD-NT also kills cell-free bacteria in vitro and may have a direct bactericidal effect within the cytosol of host cells, but the importance of direct bacterial killing in controlling in vivo infection remains to be determined.",

    "text":"Plastics, the environment and human health: current consensus and future trends. Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded.",

We examined the distal gut microbiota of three individuals over 10 mo that spanned two courses of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, analyzing more than 1.7 million bacterial 16S rRNA hypervariable region sequences from 52 to 56 samples per subject. Interindividual variation was the major source of variability between samples. Day-to-day temporal variability was evident but constrained around an average community composition that was stable over several months in the absence of deliberate perturbation. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the gut microbiota was profound and rapid, with a loss of diversity and a shift in community composition occurring within 3\u20134 d of drug initiation. By 1 wk after the end of each course, communities began to return to their initial state, but the return was often incomplete. Although broadly similar, community changes after ciprofloxacin varied among subjects and between the two courses within subjects. In all subjects, the composition of the gut microbiota stabilized by the end of the experiment but was altered from its initial state. As with other ecosystems, the human distal gut microbiome at baseline is a dynamic regimen with a stable average state.

Stress in fish caused by physical disturbances encountered in aquaculture, such as handling and transport, evokes a variety of responses that may be adaptive or maladaptive. The overall effect of stress may be considered as a change in biological condition beyond the normal resting state that challenges homeostasis and, thus, presents a threat to the fish's health. These stress-induced changes are grouped as primary; secondary, which includes metabolic, hematological, hydromineral, and structural; and tertiary or \u2018whole animal\u2019 responses. Many of these responses can be used as quantitative indicators of stress although investigators need to be aware of the various \u2018nonstress\u2019 factors that can also influence these conditions. A major focus of current research is on the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and the resultant elevation of circulating corticosteroids. Stress, through the action of corticosteroids, may (a) reduce immunocompetence by influencing lymphocyte numbers and antibody-production capacity, and (b) affect reproduction by altering levels and patterns of reproductive hormones that influence maturation. Stress may also alter metabolic scope in fish and affect growth, partly as a result of the catabolic or gluconeogenic effect of corticosteroids. Although certain stressors encountered during normal aquacultural procedures may be unavoidable, a number of practical approaches are suggested that would help to alleviate the detrimental effects of stress in fish.",

In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncertainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and assist users in checking for model errors.

Electronic structure intrinsically controls the light absorbance, redox potential, charge-carrier mobility, and consequently, photoreactivity of semiconductor photocatalysts. The conventional approach of modifying the electronic structure of a semiconductor photocatalyst for a wider absorption range by anion doping operates at the cost of reduced redox potentials and\/or charge-carrier mobility, so that its photoreactivity is usually limited and some important reactions may not occur at all. Here, we report sulfur-doped graphitic C(3)N(4) (C(3)N(4-x)S(x)) with a unique electronic structure that displays an increased valence bandwidth in combination with an elevated conduction band minimum and a slightly reduced absorbance. The C(3)N(4-x)S(x) shows a photoreactivity of H(2) evolution 7.2 and 8.0 times higher than C(3)N(4) under lambda > 300 and 420 nm, respectively. More strikingly, the complete oxidation process of phenol under lambda > 400 nm can occur for sulfur-doped C(3)N(4), which is impossible for C(3)N(4) even under lambda > 300 nm. The homogeneous substitution of sulfur for lattice nitrogen and a concomitant quantum confinement effect are identified as the cause of this unique electronic structure and, consequently, the excellent photoreactivity of C(3)N(4-x)S(x). The results acquired may shed light on general doping strategies for designing potentially efficient photocatalysts.",

Human activities over the last three centuries have significantly transformed the Earth's environment, primarily through the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture. This study presents a simple approach to derive geographically explicit changes in global croplands from 1700 to 1992. By calibrating a remotely sensed land cover classification data set against cropland inventory data, we derived a global representation of permanent croplands in 1992, at 5 min spatial resolution [Ramankutty and Foley, 1998]. To reconstruct historical croplands, we first compile an extensive database of historical cropland inventory data, at the national and subnational level, from a variety of sources. Then we use our 1992 cropland data within a simple land cover change model, along with the historical inventory data, to reconstruct global 5 min resolution data on permanent cropland areas from 1992 back to 1700. The reconstructed changes in historical croplands are consistent with the history of human settlement and patterns of economic development. By overlaying our historical cropland data set over a newly derived potential vegetation data set, we analyze our results in terms of the extent to which different natural vegetation types have been converted for agriculture. We further examine the extent to which croplands have been abandoned in different parts of the world. Our data sets could be used within global climate models and global ecosystem models to understand the impacts of land cover change on climate and on the cycling of carbon and water. Such an analysis is a crucial aid to sharpen our thinking about a sustainable future.",

Using a large cross-section of firms, we find that firms with better CSR performance face significantly lower capital constraints. We provide evidence that both better stakeholder engagement and transparency around CSR performance are important in reducing capital constraints. The results are further confirmed using several alternative measures of capital constraints, a paired analysis based on a ratings shock to CSR performance, an instrumental variables approach, and a simultaneous equations approach.

Environmental stresses trigger a wide variety of plant responses, ranging from altered gene expression and cellular metabolism to changes in growth rates and crop yields. A plethora of plant reactions exist to circumvent the potentially harmful effects caused by a wide range of both abiotic and biotic stresses, including light, drought, salinity, high temperatures, and pathogen infections. Among the environmental stresses, drought stress is one of the most adverse factors of plant growth and productivity. Understanding the biochemical and molecular responses to drought is essential for a holistic perception of plant resistance mechanisms to water-limited conditions. Drought stress progressively decreases CO2 assimilation rates due to reduced stomatal conductance. Drought stress also induces reduction in the contents and activities of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle enzymes, including the key enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase\/oxygenase. The critical roles of proline and glycine-betaine, as well as the role of abscisic acid (ABA), under drought stress conditions have been actively researched to understand the tolerance of plants to dehydration. In addition, drought stress-induced generation of active oxygen species is well recognized at the cellular level and is tightly controlled at both the production and consumption levels in vivo, through increased antioxidative systems. Knowledge of sensing and signaling pathways, including ABA-mediated changes in response to drought stress, is essential to improve crop management. This review focuses on the ability and strategies of higher plants to respond and adapt to drought stress.",

In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate.

Neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry (MS)1 is of unique value for preparing and characterizing highly reactive and unstable neutral species, such as the intermediate in the dissociative-recombination reaction H3O + ef H2O + H + 6.4 eV.2 Following an earlier suggestion,3 using neutralization accompanying surface-induced dissociation (SID)4 to form an unstable site did not yield new cleavage reactions5 in multiply charged protein cations from electrospray ionization (ESI) with Fourier transform (FT) MS.6 Serendipitously, we now find that one or more charges on such protein cations can be neutralized with low-energy electrons to cause specific cleavage of the amine bond to form c, z products,7 in contrast to the amide cleavage b, y products formed by collisionally activated dissociation (CAD),8 infrared multiphoton (IRMPD)9 and UV10 photodissociation, 70 eV electron impact excitation,11 and SID.5 The b, y products are formed by the lowest energy backbone cleavage of ESI protein ions.6-9 An attempt to cleave stronger bonds using high-energy (6.4 eV) 193 nm photons gave mainly b, y products for 2 kDa protein ions,10 but for 2.8 and 8.6 kDa protein ions12 gave small yields of c, z amine bond cleavage products not previously observed. In this further investigation, extra electrodes were placed outside the ion cell electrodes that trap the positively charged ions. With the outside electrodes at +9 V,13 extensive 193 nm laser irradiation of SWIFT-selected14 (M + 11H)11+ ubiquitin ions (8.6 kDa) only produces b, y, not c, z, ions. However, with the outside electrodes at -1 V, the c, z products are formed along with 10+ molecular ions; unexpectedly, these are mainly (M + 11H)10+\u2022 ions (Figure 1d), 1 Da heavier than the (M + 10H)10+ ions formed by ESI (Figure 1c). The 4+ mellitin ion spectrum measured under the same conditions (Figure 1b) similarly contains (M + 4H)3+\u2022, consistent with capture of secondary electrons formed by the 193 nm photons impinging on metal surfaces and trapped by the -1 V electrodes: (M + 4H)4+ + ef (M + 4H)3+\u2022.15 Electrons were produced instead (no laser) by a conventional heated filament source outside the FTMS magnet opposite the ESI source.11 With a 10-5 Torr Ar pulse for ecooling (energy < 0.2 eV; an SF6 pulse lowered the efficiency), the 11+ ions of ubiquitin gave a spectrum that showed c, z cleavage of 50 out of 75 backbone positions; CAD8\/IRMPD9 gave b, y cleavage of eight of these positions plus seven others. Cooled electrons plus the 15+ ions of FeIII equine cytochrome c16 produced (Figure 2) c, z fragment ions from cleavages at all but 40 of the 103 possible backbone sites (e.g., N-terminal side of Pro, none; of Ile, Leu, Val, few); CAD produces b, y cleavages (total 19) at eight additional sites. The 21+ apomyoglobin ions (17 kDa) yielded 33 c, z cleavages, but the 34+ ions of bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) as yet has given only 33+, 32+, and 31+ molecular ions. Electron capture dissociation (ECD)1-3 rationalizes these results. The capture cross section should be proportional to the ionic charge squared, consistent with the minimal secondary fragmentations to produce internal ions and the predominance of cleavages in the central\u223c70% of the protein chain. Charge values and masses17 of the complementary product ions are consistent with dissociation after ecapture, such as c39\/z37 from the 76-residue ubiquitin 11+ ions and c69\/z35 from the 104residue cytochrome c 15+ ions.

We sought to determine the course of cognitive change during the five years after CABG and the effect of perioperative decline on long-term cognitive function.In 261 patients who underwent CABG, neurocognitive tests were performed preoperatively (at base line), before discharge, and six weeks, six months, and five years after CABG surgery. Decline in postoperative function was defined as a drop of 1 SD or more in the scores on tests of any one of four domains of cognitive function. (A reduction of 1 SD represents a decline in function of approximately 20 percent.) Overall neurocognitive status was assessed with a composite cognitive index score representing the sum of the scores for the individual domains. Factors predicting long-term cognitive decline were determined by multivariable logistic and linear regression.Among the patients studied, the incidence of cognitive decline was 53 percent at discharge, 36 percent at six weeks, 24 percent at six months, and 42 percent at five years. We investigated predictors of cognitive decline at five years and found that cognitive function at discharge was a significant predictor of long-term function (P<0.001).These results confirm the relatively high prevalence and persistence of cognitive decline after CABG and suggest a pattern of early improvement followed by a later decline that is predicted by the presence of early postoperative cognitive decline.

A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior of such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content on the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI1, MTVI2, and MCARI2) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI2), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCARI2 and MTVI2 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r 2 ) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat.

    "text":"Three-Dimensional Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering Applications: Role of Porosity and Pore Size. Tissue engineering applications commonly encompass the use of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds to provide a suitable microenvironment for the incorporation of cells or growth factors to regenerate damaged tissues or organs. These scaffolds serve to mimic the actual in vivo microenvironment where cells interact and behave according to the mechanical cues obtained from the surrounding 3D environment. Hence, the material properties of the scaffolds are vital in determining cellular response and fate. These 3D scaffolds are generally highly porous with interconnected pore networks to facilitate nutrient and oxygen diffusion and waste removal. This review focuses on the various fabrication techniques (e.g., conventional and rapid prototyping methods) that have been employed to fabricate 3D scaffolds of different pore sizes and porosity. The different pore size and porosity measurement methods will also be discussed. Scaffolds with graded porosity have also been studied for their ability to better represent the actual in vivo situation where cells are exposed to layers of different tissues with varying properties. In addition, the ability of pore size and porosity of scaffolds to direct cellular responses and alter the mechanical properties of scaffolds will be reviewed, followed by a look at nature's own scaffold, the extracellular matrix. Overall, the limitations of current scaffold fabrication approaches for tissue engineering applications and some novel and promising alternatives will be highlighted.",

    "text":"Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing. Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from Sandstrom\u2019s theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 \u201cAbyssal Recipes\u201d, which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2\/s (1 cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global upwelling associated with 25 Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5 m2\/s \u2014 a low value confirmed by dye release experiments.\r\n\r\nA new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity, but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence) are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology we find that 2.1 TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30 Sverdrups of deep water formation.\r\n\r\nThe winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 TW (2.50\u00b10.05 TW from M2 alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX\/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6\u20130.9 TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1 TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain.\r\n\r\nA surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000 TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the Earth\u2013Moon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.",

The genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,961,146 bp and 1,072,314 bp that together encode 3,885 open reading frames. The vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions (such as DNA replication, transcription, translation and cell-wall biosynthesis) and pathogenicity (for example, toxins, surface antigens and adhesins) are located on the large chromosome. In contrast, the small chromosome contains a larger fraction (59%) of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome (42%), and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the \u03b3-Proteobacteria.

To investigate the initial chemical events associated with high-temperature gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, we have expanded the ReaxFF reactive force field training set to include additional transition states and chemical reactivity of systems relevant to these reactions and optimized the force field parameters against a quantum mechanics (QM)-based training set. To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT\u2212MD simulations on various hydrocarbon\/O2 systems. From simulations on methane\/O2, o-xylene\/O2, propene\/O2, and benzene\/O2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the C\u2212H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO\/CO2\/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.",

In this article, we investigate the relation between the intake of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and the development of obesity. We analyzed food consumption patterns by using US Department of Agriculture food consumption tables from 1967 to 2000. The consumption of HFCS increased > 1000% between 1970 and 1990, far exceeding the changes in intake of any other food or food group. HFCS now represents > 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages and is the sole caloric sweetener in soft drinks in the United States. Our most conservative estimate of the consumption of HFCS indicates a daily average of 132 kcal for all Americans aged \u2265 2 y, and the top 20% of consumers of caloric sweeteners ingest 316 kcal from HFCS\/d. The increased use of HFCS in the United States mirrors the rapid increase in obesity. The digestion, absorption, and metabolism of fructose differ from those of glucose. Hepatic metabolism of fructose favors de novo lipogenesis. In addition, unlike glucose, fructose does not stimulate insulin secretion or enhance leptin production. Because insulin and leptin act as key afferent signals in the regulation of food intake and body weight, this suggests that dietary fructose may contribute to increased energy intake and weight gain. Furthermore, calorically sweetened beverages may enhance caloric overconsumption. Thus, the increase in consumption of HFCS has a temporal relation to the epidemic of obesity, and the overconsumption of HFCS in calorically sweetened beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity.",

    "text":"An assessment of the effectiveness of a random forest classifier for land-cover classification. Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20%, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level.",

Intratumor heterogeneity, which fosters tumor evolution, is a key challenge in cancer medicine. Here, we review data and technologies that have revealed intra-tumor heterogeneity across cancer types and the dynamics, constraints, and contingencies inherent to tumor evolution. We emphasize the importance of macro-evolutionary leaps, often involving large-scale chromosomal alterations, in driving tumor evolution and metastasis and consider the role of the tumor microenvironment in engendering heterogeneity and drug resistance. We suggest that bold approaches to drug development, harnessing the adaptive properties of the immune-microenvironment while limiting those of the tumor, combined with advances in clinical trial-design, will improve patient outcome. In a famous thought experiment, evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould asked, if the \u201ctape of life\u201d could be turned back to the very beginning, would the same outcome prevail (Gould, 2000Gould S.J. Wonderful life: the Burgess Shale and the nature of history. Random House, 2000Google Scholar)? While re-playing the tape of life remains a hypothetical experiment, the \u201ctape of cancer\u201d is being played and re-played with increasing regularity and too frequently with lethal results. Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths occurring in 2012 alone (Siegel et al., 2013Siegel R. Naishadham D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2013.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2013; 63: 11-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (8724) Google Scholar). Alarmingly, the number of new cases is predicted to rise by 70% over the next two decades. A key factor contributing to the lethal outcome of cancer, therapeutic failure, and drug resistance is intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) (Greaves, 2015Greaves M. Evolutionary determinants of cancer.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5: 806-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ITH provides diverse genetic and epigenetic material upon which selection and Darwinian evolution can act. However, this diversity also permits the tape of each cancer\u2019s life to be deciphered, revealing the temporal order of genomic events and shedding light on constraints and contingencies to cancer evolutionary trajectories. The advent of next-generation sequencing has enabled more powerful analysis of tumor evolution and has improved our understanding of tumor initiation and development, as well as the interaction between cancer cells and the immune-microenvironment. Despite these advances, knowledge of ITH and clonal evolution and the potential for competitive release of resistant subclones is infrequently considered in the therapeutic setting to inform clinical trial design. In this review, we explore the extent and clinical implications of ITH and discuss how profiling tumor genetic diversity has been used to trace tumors\u2019 life histories and their patterns of evolution. We emphasize the importance of viewing tumor development in the context of an evolutionary framework, which includes large-scale genomic alterations, and consider the dynamic evolution of tumor cells and their interaction with the microenvironment. Finally, we outline approaches to address cancer systemically, taking into account ITH and tumor evolution. Genomic diversity within single tumors has long been recognized. Indeed, as early as 1958, evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley commented on \u201cgenetic inhomogeneity\u201d in cancer, noting, \u201cit will be of great interest to discover the extent of such new variance and the rate at which it occurs\u201d (Huxley, 1958Huxley J. The Biological Aspects of Cancer. Harcourt, Brace, New York1958Google Scholar). However, it is only with the advent of next-generation sequencing studies that the full extent of genomic ITH is becoming apparent. Sequencing of spatially or temporally distinct tumor regions has begun to uncover the bewildering extent of diversity within tumors (Figure 1). These studies have revealed that the degree of ITH can be highly variable, with between 0 and over 8,000 thousand coding mutations found to be heterogeneous within primary tumors or between primary and metastatic or recurrence sites (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson B.E. Mazor T. Hong C. Barnes M. Aihara K. McLean C.Y. Fouse S.D. Yamamoto S. Ueda H. Tatsuno K. et al.Mutational analysis reveals the origin and therapy-driven evolution of recurrent glioma.Science. 2014; 343: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Despite caveats regarding differences in sampling procedure, tumor stage, and sequencing depth, it is evident that certain tumor types, such as melanoma and lung cancer, harbor a significantly larger homogeneous coding mutational burden than other types. The involvement of powerful exogenous mutagens, such as ultraviolet light and tobacco carcinogens, which a stem cell niche may be exposed to for years prior to the first invasive step, likely explains the elevated clonal mutational burden in these cancers. Accordingly, the prevalence of different types of base-substitutions (within a trinucleotide context) observed in these tumors reflects their exogenous exposures (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C. Aparicio S.A. Behjati S. Biankin A.V. Bignell G.R. Bolli N. Borg A. B\u00f8rresen-Dale A.L. et al.Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome InitiativeICGC Breast Cancer ConsortiumICGC MMML-Seq ConsortiumICGC PedBrainSignatures of mutational processes in human cancer.Nature. 2013; 500: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). It is also evident that a large clonal burden does not equate to a large subclonal burden, or vice versa. Predominantly, this likely reflects the fact that distinct mutational processes may operate at different times in tumor evolution (de Bruin et al., 2014de Bruin E.C. McGranahan N. Mitter R. Salm M. Wedge D.C. Yates L. Jamal-Hanjani M. Shafi S. Murugaesu N.

Indeed, the most notable outliers with regard to high subclonal mutational burden, but low clonal burden, are low-grade gliomas that recur as glioblastomas after treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson B.E. Mazor T. Hong C. Barnes M. Aihara K. McLean C.Y. Fouse S.D. Yamamoto S. Ueda H.

Hu J. et al.Whole-genome and multisector exome sequencing of primary and post-treatment glioblastoma reveals patterns of tumor evolution.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this case, the abundance of subclonal mutations can be directly linked to therapy-induced mutations that are compounded by loss of mismatch repair machinery. As more data accumulates, the impact of therapy on mutational load and ITH will likely become clearer. In other cancer types, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer, the presence of a large subclonal mutation burden can be attributed to the action of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (de Bruin et al., 2014de Bruin E.C. McGranahan N. Mitter R. Salm M. Wedge D.C. Yates L. Jamal-Hanjani M. Shafi S. Murugaesu N.

Gumbs C. et al.Intratumor heterogeneity in localized lung adenocarcinomas delineated by multiregion sequencing.Science. 2014; 346: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In colorectal and prostate cancers, alterations to mismatch repair or proofreading machinery can occasionally play a key role in generating both clonal and subclonal mutations (Kumar et al., 2016Kumar A. Coleman I. Morrissey C. Zhang X. True L.D. Gulati R. Etzioni R. Bolouri H. Montgomery B. White T. et al.Substantial interindividual and limited intraindividual genomic diversity among tumors from men with metastatic prostate cancer.Nat.

Shinden Y. et al.Integrated Multiregional Analysis Proposing a New Model of Colorectal Cancer Evolution.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12: e1005778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with results from mathematical modeling (Tomasetti et al., 2013Tomasetti C. Vogelstein B. Parmigiani G. Half or more of the somatic mutations in cancers of self-renewing tissues originate prior to tumor initiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these studies also suggest that the clonal mutation burden in certain cancer types, including lung cancer and melanoma, predominantly reflects mutations accumulated prior to carcinogenesis, while in others, mutation burden may be more reflective of somatic events occurring after tumorigenesis. As such, the mutation rate of a tumor cannot necessarily be inferred from a single biopsy, and simply considering the proportion of heterogeneous mutations represents a poor surrogate for diversity (Figure 1). Importantly, heterogeneity does not simply affect coding mutations. A multitude of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and post-translational modification of histones, can contribute to diversity within tumors (for a review, see Mazor et al., 2016Mazor T. Pankov A. Song J.S. Costello J.F. Intratumoral Heterogeneity of the Epigenome.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 440-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Liu W. Engelmann J.C. Nuhn P. Gurel M. Haffner M.C. Esopi D. Irizarry R.A. Getzenberg R.H.

Lu C.C. Shi Z.Z. Xu X. et al.Spatial intratumoral heterogeneity and temporal clonal evolution in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 1500-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), has suggested that the extent of ITH calculated from DNA methylation mirrors ITH measures captured at the genomic level. Genomic copy-number heterogeneity can also be extensive within tumors, to the extent that copy-number ITH in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) mirrors the extent of copy-number diversity between tumors (Martinez et al., 2013Martinez P. Birkbak N.J. Gerlinger M. McGranahan N. Burrell R.A. Rowan A.J. Joshi T. Fisher R. Larkin J. Szallasi Z. Swanton C. Parallel evolution of tumour subclones mimics diversity between tumours.J. Pathol. 2013; 230: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Large-scale chromosomal alterations may have profound impact upon the genome, disrupting hundreds of genes, and can be considered macro-evolutionary events (see below), which may contribute to tumor progression (Notta et al., 2016Notta F.

A tumor\u2019s mutational catalog represents a historical record of alterations that have accumulated during its life history. The heterogeneity present between cancer cells can be used to illuminate the temporal order of these events. Alterations identified in every sequenced cancer cell can be considered to form the trunk of a cancer\u2019s somatic evolutionary tree, while subclonal mutations, present in only a subset of cancer cells, make up the branches (Figure 2). Further, the prevalence of subclonal mutations in different cancer cells can be used to infer the subclonal hierarchy of the tumor\u2019s phylogeny. A plethora of bioinformatics tools have been developed to help decipher the temporal order of mutations and determine which are clonal or subclonal. The majority of tools focus on somatic point mutations and either restrict the analysis to copy neutral regions of the genome or make the assumption that a single mutation will be present at the same copy-number state in every cancer cell (Carter et al., 2012Carter S.L.

USA. 2016; 113: E5528-E5537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relatedly, orthogonal tools to dissect heterogeneity by using data from single-cell sequencing have also been developed (Roth et al., 2016Roth A. McPherson A. Laks E. Biele J. Yap D. Wan A. Smith M.A. Nielsen C.B. McAlpine J.N. Aparicio S. et al.Clonal genotype and population structure inference from single-cell tumor sequencing.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, despite considerable advances, it is self-evident that even cutting-edge tools can only dissect the ITH within the sample(s) subject to sequencing. As such, our ability to distinguish truly clonal from pseudo-clonal mutations is largely dependent on the number of tumor regions sequenced (de Bruin et al., 2014de Bruin E.C. McGranahan N. Mitter R. Salm M. Wedge D.C. Yates L. Jamal-Hanjani M. Shafi S. Murugaesu N.

Med. 2015; 21: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the depth and purity of what is sequenced, and, further, whether single-cell sequencing is also implemented (Roth et al., 2016Roth A. McPherson A. Laks E. Biele J. Yap D. Wan A. Smith M.A. Nielsen C.B. McAlpine J.N. Aparicio S. et al.Clonal genotype and population structure inference from single-cell tumor sequencing.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Studies exploring ITH within solid tumors have demonstrated a tendency for established cancer genes to harbor clonal mutations (Kumar et al., 2016Kumar A. Coleman I. Morrissey C. Zhang X. True L.D.

Szallasi Z. Swanton C. Clonal status of actionable driver events and the timing of mutational processes in cancer evolution.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 283ra54Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, despite this tendency, even mutations in established cancer genes can be present in only a subset of cancer cells within a tumor. Subclonal driver mutations can give an illusion of clonality due to sampling bias. Whole-genome sequencing of 33 pairs of medulloblastomas, pre- and post-therapy, found that the majority of putative drug targets that were identified pre-treatment appeared clonal but were revealed to be subclonal or absent at recurrence (Morrissy et al., 2016Morrissy A.S. Garzia L. Shih D.J. Zuyderduyn S. Huang X. Skowron P. Remke M. Cavalli F.M. Ramaswamy V. Lindsay P.E. et al.Divergent clonal selection dominates medulloblastoma at recurrence.Nature. 2016; 529: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Equally, ITH may lead to significant underestimates of the number of driver alterations present in a tumor. Analysis of 86 cases of diverse primary tumors and brain metastases revealed that, in 53% of cases, putative drug targets, including PTEN and PIK3CA, were exclusively identified in the brain lesions and not in the primary tumor (Brastianos et al., 2015Brastianos P.K.

Accumulating evidence suggests that certain driver alterations may be more likely to be subclonal than others. Subclonal mutations in PIK3CA have been found in NSCLC (de Bruin et al., 2014de Bruin E.C. McGranahan N. Mitter R. Salm M. Wedge D.C. Yates L. Jamal-Hanjani M. Shafi S. Murugaesu N.

Pathol. 2013; 231: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In keeping with these results, across nine cancer types, mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were found to harbor a higher proportion of subclonal mutations compared to genes associated with RAS-MAPK pathway (McGranahan et al., 2015McGranahan N.

Wang L. et al.Evolution and impact of subclonal mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Cell. 2013; 152: 714-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Such differences may reflect the importance of epistasis in cancer evolution and are in agreement with findings that co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships between cancer driver alterations can vary extensively in different cancer types (Park and Lehner, 2015Park S. Lehner B. Cancer type-dependent genetic interactions between cancer driver alterations indicate plasticity of epistasis across cell types.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11: 824Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The subclonal nature of genomic driver alterations can have important clinical implications. A recent report demonstrated that two gastric cancers with high clonal amplification of FGFR2 responded to the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547. Conversely, the six tumors with low or subclonal amplification of FGFR2 did not respond (Pearson et al., 2016Pearson A. Smyth E. Babina I.S. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Tarazona N. Peckitt C. Kilgour E.

In CLL, the presence of subclonal driver alterations is associated with decreased relapse-free survival (Landau et al., 2013Landau D.A. Carter S.L. Stojanov P. McKenna A. Stevenson K. Lawrence M.S.

Although originally framed in relation to the evolution of individual organisms within a population, the fundamental principles of Darwinian evolution, involving variation with differential fitness that is heritable, can be applied in the context of tumor evolution (Nowell, 1976Nowell P.C.

The responses of each of these groups are evaluated separately against the four main water quality parameters: (1) increased dissolved inorganic nutrients, (2) enrichment with particulate organic matter, (3) light reduction from turbidity and (4) increased sedimentation. This separation facilitates disentangling and understanding the mechanisms leading to changes in the field, where many contaminants and many responses co-occur. The review also summarises geographic and biological factors that determine local and regional levels of resistance and resilience to degradation.

Microstructural stability and phases observed during processing and in subsequent elevated-temperature service are summarized. Processing paths and recent advances in processing are addressed. Mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms are reviewed, including tensile properties, creep, fatigue, and cyclic crack growth. I. Introduction N ICKEL-BASED superalloys are an unusual class of metallic materials with an exceptional combination of hightemperature strength, toughness, and resistance to degradation in corrosive or oxidizing environments. These materials are widely used in aircraft and power-generation turbines, rocket engines, and other challenging environments, including nuclear power and chemical processing plants. Intensive alloy and process development activities during the past few decades have resulted in alloys that can tolerate average temperatures of 1050 \u25e6 C with occasional excursions (or local hot spots near airfoil tips) to temperatures as high as 1200 \u25e6 C, 1 which is approximately 90% of the melting point of the material. The underlying aspects of microstructure and composition that result in these exceptional properties are briefly reviewed here. Major classes of superalloys that are utilized in gas-turbine engines and the corresponding processes for their production are outlined along with characteristic mechanical and physical properties.",

    "text":"Black Carbon Increases Cation Exchange Capacity in Soils. Black Carbon (BC) may significantly affect nutrient retention and play a key role in a wide range of biogeochemical processes in soils, especially for nutrient cycling. Anthrosols from the Brazilian Amazon (ages between 600 and 8700 yr BP) with high contents of biomass-derived BC had greater potential cation exchange capacity (CEC measured at pH 7) per unit organic C than adjacent soils with low BC contents. Synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy coupled with scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) techniques explained the source of the higher surface charge of BC compared with non-BC by mapping cross-sectional areas of BC particles with diameters of 10 to 50 \u03bcm for C forms. The largest cross-sectional areas consisted of highly aromatic or only slightly oxidized organic C most likely originating from the BC itself with a characteristic peak at 286.1 eV, which could not be found in humic substance extracts, bacteria or fungi. Oxidation significantly increased from the core of BC particles to their surfaces as shown by the ratio of carboxyl-C\/aromatic-C. Spotted and non-continuous distribution patterns of highly oxidized C functional groups with distinctly different chemical signatures on BC particle surfaces (peak shift at 286.1 eV to a higher energy of 286.7 eV) indicated that non-BC may be adsorbed on the surfaces of BC particles creating highly oxidized surface. As a consequence of both oxidation of the BC particles themselves and adsorption of organic matter to BC surfaces, the charge density (potential CEC per unit surface area) was greater in BC-rich Anthrosols than adjacent soils. Additionally, a high specific surface area was attributable to the presence of BC, which may contribute to the high CEC found in soils that are rich in BC.",

The deletion of LKB1 in the liver of adult mice resulted in a nearly complete loss of AMPK activity. Loss of LKB1 function resulted in hyperglycemia with increased gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. In LKB1-deficient livers, TORC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), was dephosphorylated and entered the nucleus, driving the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), which in turn drives gluconeogenesis. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TORC2 reduced PGC-1alpha expression and normalized blood glucose levels in mice with deleted liver LKB1, indicating that TORC2 is a critical target of LKB1\/AMPK signals in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.

Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free.

Ingestion of microplastics by marine biota, including mussels, worms, fish, and seabirds, has been widely reported, but despite their vital ecological role in marine food-webs, the impact of microplastics on zooplankton remains under-researched. Here, we show that microplastics are ingested by, and may impact upon, zooplankton. We used bioimaging techniques to document ingestion, egestion, and adherence of microplastics in a range of zooplankton common to the northeast Atlantic, and employed feeding rate studies to determine the impact of plastic detritus on algal ingestion rates in copepods. Using fluorescence and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy we identified that thirteen zooplankton taxa had the capacity to ingest 1.7\u201330.6 \u03bcm polystyrene beads, with uptake varying by taxa, life-stage and bead-size. Post-ingestion, copepods egested faecal pellets laden with microplastics. We further observed microplastics adhered to the external carapace and appendages of exposed zooplankton. Exposure of the copepod Centropages typicus to natural assemblages of algae with and without microplastics showed that 7.3 \u03bcm microplastics (>4000 mL\u20131) significantly decreased algal feeding.

Plants are finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment, and shifts in the timing of plant activity (i.e. phenology) provide some of the most compelling evidence that species and ecosystems are being influenced by global environmental change.

    "text":"A long noncoding RNA maintains active chromatin to coordinate homeotic gene expression. A major question in developmental biology is how functionally related groups of genes are switched on at the right time and in the right place. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been implicated in both gene silencing and activation, and could be a means of long-range control of gene expression. A lincRNA termed HOTTIP that coordinates the activation of multiple 5' HOXA regulatory genes has now been identified at the 5' tip of the HOXA locus. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP close its target genes, where it facilitates histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been implicated in both gene silencing and activation, and could be a means for long-range control of gene expression. Here a lincRNA termed HOTTIP is identified at the 5\u2032 tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of multiple 5\u2032 HOXA genes. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into the proximity of its target genes, where it seems to be required to facilitate histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. The genome is extensively transcribed into long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), many of which are implicated in gene silencing1,2. Potential roles of lincRNAs in gene activation are much less understood3,4,5. Development and homeostasis require coordinate regulation of neighbouring genes through a process termed locus control6. Some locus control elements and enhancers transcribe lincRNAs7,8,9,10, hinting at possible roles in long-range control. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes, encoding homeodomain transcription factors critical for positional identity, are clustered in four chromosomal loci; the Hox genes are expressed in nested anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterns colinear with their genomic position from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032of the cluster11. Here we identify HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5\u2032 tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of several 5\u2032 HOXA genes in vivo. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into close proximity to its target genes. HOTTIP RNA binds the adaptor protein WDR5 directly and targets WDR5\/MLL complexes across HOXA, driving histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Induced proximity is necessary and sufficient for HOTTIP RNA activation of its target genes. Thus, by serving as key intermediates that transmit information from higher order chromosomal looping into chromatin modifications, lincRNAs may organize chromatin domains to coordinate long-range gene activation.",

The probability that a pair of ions of given initial separation will recombine with each other is computed from the laws of Brownian motion, which is the proper procedure whenever the Langevin factor equals unity, as in gases at high pressures.

This result includes the correlation between temperature and pressure coefficients of the ionization by light particles previously predicted by Compton, Bennett and Stearns, if one allows their basic hypothesis about the laws which govern the initial separation of the ions. The effect of an electric field is to increase the fraction of escaping ions by a factor which in the incipient stage of the effect is proportional to the field intensity and independent of the initial distance, although it depends on the orientation of an ion pair. The predicted increase of the ionization current is a little more than one percent for every 100 volts\/cm, which accounts for the observed effects of fields exceeding 1500 volts\/cm. A reasonable amount of columnar recombination would help to explain the proportionately greater effects of weak fields.

Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.",

Carbon dots (CDs) with tunable photoluminescence (PL) and a quantum yield of up to 35% in water were hydrothermally synthesized in one pot and separated via silica column chromatography. These separated CDs emitted bright and stable luminescence in gradient colors from blue to red under a single-wavelength UV light. They exhibited high optical uniformity; that is, every sample showed only one peak in the PL excitation spectrum, only one peak in the excitation-independent PL emission spectrum, and similar monoexponential fluorescence lifetimes. Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation. Therefore, the observed red shift in their emission peaks from 440 to 625 nm was ascribed to a gradual reduction in their band gaps with the increasing incorporation of oxygen species into their surface structures. These energy bands were found to depend on the surface groups and structures but not on the particle size, not as in traditional semiconductor quantum dots. In addition, because of their excellent PL properties and low cytotoxicity, these CDs could be used to image cells in different colors under a single-wavelength light source, and the red-emitting CDs could be used to image live mice because of the strong penetration capability of their fluorescence.",

An algorithm for the construction of phase diagram sections is formulated that is well suited for geodynamic problems in which it is necessary to assess the influence of phase transitions on rock properties or the evolution and migration of fluids. The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to > 25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is < 2 wt.%.",

In our analysis we estimated fuel loads, including organic soil layer and peatland fuels, and the net flux from terrestrial ecosystems as the balance between net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and biomass burning, using time varying inputs of precipitation (PPT), temperature, solar radiation, and satellite-derived fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR). For the 1997\u20132004 period, we found that on average approximately 58 Pg C year\u22121 was fixed by plants as NPP, and approximately 95% of this was returned back to the atmosphere via Rh. Another 4%, or 2.5 Pg C year\u22121 was emitted by biomass burning; the remainder consisted of losses from fuel wood collection and subsequent burning. At a global scale, burned area and total fire emissions were largely decoupled from year to year. Total carbon emissions tracked burning in forested areas (including deforestation fires in the tropics), whereas burned area was largely controlled by savanna fires that responded to different environmental and human factors. Biomass burning emissions showed large interannual variability with a range of more than 1 Pg C year\u22121, with a maximum in 1998 (3.2 Pg C year\u22121) and a minimum in 2000 (2.0 Pg C year\u22121).",

The creation of nanoparticles with optimal clearance characteristics will minimize toxicity risks by reducing the duration of exposure to these agents. Given that many nanoparticles possess easily modifiable surface and interior chemistry, if nanoparticle characteristics associated with optimal clearance from the body were well established, it would be feasible to design and create agents with more favorable clearance properties. This article presents a thorough discussion of the physiologic aspects of nanoparticle clearance, focusing on renal mechanisms, and provides an overview of current research investigating clearance of specific types of nanoparticles and nano-sized macromolecules, including dendrimers, quantum dots, liposomes and carbon, gold and silica-based nanoparticles.",

It is shown how the dynamic properties of the proteins and pigments of the chlorophyll a\/b light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II first enable the level of excitation energy to be sensed via the thylakoid proton gradient and subsequently allow excess energy to be dissipated as heat by formation of a nonphotochemical quencher.

Although it is well established that soils are the dominating source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N 2 O), we are still struggling to fully understand the complexity of the underlying microbial production and consumption processes and the links to biotic (e.g. inter- and intraspecies competition, food webs, plant\u2013microbe interaction) and abiotic (e.g. soil climate, physics and chemistry) factors. Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant\u2013microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N 2 O fluxes at the soil\u2013atmosphere interface.

This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N 2 O (and N 2 ) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N 2 O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.",

New evidence shows that older adults need more dietary protein than do younger adults to support good health, promote recovery from illness, and maintain functionality. Older people need to make up for age-related changes in protein metabolism, such as high splanchnic extraction and declining anabolic responses to ingested protein. They also need more protein to offset inflammatory and catabolic conditions associated with chronic and acute diseases that occur commonly with aging. With the goal of developing updated, evidence-based recommendations for optimal protein intake by older people, the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS), in cooperation with other scientific organizations, appointed an international study group to review dietary protein needs with aging (PROT-AGE Study Group). To help older people (>65 years) maintain and regain lean body mass and function, the PROT-AGE study group recommends average daily intake at least in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 g protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Both endurance- and resistance-type exercises are recommended at individualized levels that are safe and tolerated, and higher protein intake (ie, \u22651.2 g\/kg body weight\/d) is advised for those who are exercising and otherwise active. Most older adults who have acute or chronic diseases need even more dietary protein (ie, 1.2\u20131.5 g\/kg body weight\/d). Older people with severe kidney disease (ie, estimated GFR <30 mL\/min\/1.73m2), but who are not on dialysis, are an exception to this rule; these individuals may need to limit protein intake. Protein quality, timing of ingestion, and intake of other nutritional supplements may be relevant, but evidence is not yet sufficient to support specific recommendations. Older people are vulnerable to losses in physical function capacity, and such losses predict loss of independence, falls, and even mortality. Thus, future studies aimed at pinpointing optimal protein intake in specific populations of older people need to include measures of physical function.",

Our work reveals intricate pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics. The diet of industrialized nations has experienced a decrease in fiber intake, which for many is now well below the recommended daily range of 28\u221235 g for adults, and this deficit has been linked to several diseases (Burkitt et al., 1972Burkitt D.P. Walker A.R.P. Painter N.S. Effect of dietary fibre on stools and the transit-times, and its role in the causation of disease.Lancet. 1972; 2: 1408-1412Abstract PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Starving our microbial self: the deleterious consequences of a diet deficient in microbiota-accessible carbohydrates.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 779-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fiber provides direct physical benefits, including increased fecal bulking and laxation (Burkitt et al., 1972Burkitt D.P. Walker A.R.P. Painter N.S. Effect of dietary fibre on stools and the transit-times, and its role in the causation of disease.Lancet. 1972; 2: 1408-1412Abstract PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). However, another feature of dietary fiber\u2014a nutrient category that includes a broad array of polysaccharides that are not digestible by human enzymes\u2014has also drawn it into the spotlight: it provides an important substrate to the community of microbes (microbiota) that inhabits the distal gut (Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Starving our microbial self: the deleterious consequences of a diet deficient in microbiota-accessible carbohydrates.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 779-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Unlike humans, who produce \u223c17 gastrointestinal enzymes to digest mostly starch, our gut microbiota produces thousands of complementary enzymes with diverse specificities, enabling them to depolymerize and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host-absorbable short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (El Kaoutari et al., 2013El Kaoutari A. Armougom F. Gordon J.I. Raoult D. Henrissat B. The abundance and variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiology of the gut microbiota is geared toward dietary polysaccharide metabolism. At present, relatively little is known about how a fiber-deprived gut microbiota fulfils its energy demands and how low fiber-induced microbiota changes impact our health. Apart from dietary fiber, an alternative energy source for the microbiota is the glycoprotein-rich mucus layer that overlies the gut epithelium as a first line of defense against both commensal microbes and invading pathogens (Johansson et al., 2013Johansson M.E.V. Sj\u00f6vall H. Hansson G.C. The gastrointestinal mucus system in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, McGuckin et al., 2011McGuckin M.A. Lind\u00e9n S.K. Sutton P. Florin T.H. Mucin dynamics and enteric pathogens.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The colonic mucus layer is a dynamic and chemically complex barrier composed largely of secreted mucin-2 glycoprotein (MUC2) (Johansson et al., 2008Johansson M.E.V. Phillipson M. Petersson J. Velcich A. Holm L. Hansson G.C. The inner of the two Muc2 mucin-dependent mucus layers in colon is devoid of bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15064-15069Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Goblet cells secrete MUC2 as a disulfide cross-linked network that expands to form an inner layer, which is tightly adherent to the epithelium and is poorly colonized by commensal bacteria. As bacterial and host enzymes continuously hydrolyze the luminal edge of this layer, a looser outer layer is formed that supports a more dense and metabolically distinct community (Li et al., 2015Li H. Limenitakis J.P. Fuhrer T. Geuking M.B. Lawson M.A. Wyss M. Brugiroux S. Keller I. Macpherson J.A. Rupp S. et al.The outer mucus layer hosts a distinct intestinal microbial niche.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A key nutritional aspect of the mucus layer for gut bacteria is its high polysaccharide content, with up to 80% of the mucin biomass being composed of mostly O-linked glycans (Johansson et al., 2013Johansson M.E.V. Sj\u00f6vall H. Hansson G.C. The gastrointestinal mucus system in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). However, only a distinct subset of gut microbiota species has evolved the capacity to utilize this nutrient source (Hoskins and Boulding, 1981Hoskins L.C. Boulding E.T. Mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. Evidence for the existence and role of bacterial subpopulations producing glycosidases as extracellular enzymes.J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Png et al., 2010Png C.W. Lind\u00e9n S.K. Gilshenan K.S. Zoetendal E.G. McSweeney C.S. Sly L.I. McGuckin M.A. Florin T.H.J. Mucolytic bacteria with increased prevalence in IBD mucosa augment in vitro utilization of mucin by other bacteria.Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2010; 105: 2420-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The direct impact of fiber polysaccharides on the microbiota, combined with the ability of at least one nutritional generalist (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) to shift from dietary polysaccharides to mucus glycan metabolism in the absence of fiber (Sonnenburg et al., 2005Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.-H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Glycan foraging in vivo by an intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont.Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), suggests a connection between diet and the status of the colonic mucus barrier.

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms with respect to involvement of the microbiota and, perhaps more importantly, consequences for the host remain largely unknown. Such knowledge is important as it could provide explanations for why deviations or imbalances in gut microbial community membership and physiology (\u201cdysbiosis\u201d) correlate with several negative health outcomes, including pathogen susceptibility, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colon cancer (Cameron and Sperandio, 2015Cameron E.A.

Finally, such knowledge could inform therapeutic and preventative strategies to correct these conditions. The integrity of the mucus layer is critical for health. Genetic ablation of Muc2 in mice brings bacteria into close contact with the epithelium, leading to inflammation and colon cancer (Van der Sluis et al., 2006Van der Sluis M.

Additional studies have implicated reduced or abnormal mucus production or O-glycosylation in the development of intestinal inflammation (Fu et al., 2011Fu J. Wei B. Wen T. Johansson M.E.V. Liu X. Bradford E. Thomsson K.A. McGee S. Mansour L. Tong M. et al.Loss of intestinal core 1-derived O-glycans causes spontaneous colitis in mice.J. Clin.

Gustafsson J.K. Holm\u00e9n-Larsson J. Jabbar K.S. Xia L. Xu H. Ghishan F.K. Carvalho F.A. Gewirtz A.T. Sj\u00f6vall H. Hansson G.C. Bacteria penetrate the normally impenetrable inner colon mucus layer in both murine colitis models and patients with ulcerative colitis.Gut. 2014; 63: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mucus barrier\u2014a reservoir of antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins\u2014is the first structure that a mucosal pathogen must overcome to establish an infection (McGuckin et al., 2011McGuckin M.A. Lind\u00e9n S.K. Sutton P. Florin T.H. Mucin dynamics and enteric pathogens.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Given that the status of the mucus layer is precariously balanced between replenishment by goblet cells and degradation by gut bacteria, we hypothesized that a fiber-deprived microbiota would progressively forage on this barrier, leading to inflammation and\/or increased pathogen susceptibility. We aimed to investigate the mechanistic connections between chronic or intermittent dietary fiber deprivation on microbiota composition and physiology as well as the resulting effects on the mucus barrier. To create a model that facilitates functional interpretation, we assembled a synthetic gut microbiota from fully sequenced human gut bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. In the face of reduced dietary fiber, we examined changes in community physiology and susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium, a murine pathogen that models human enteric E. coli infection (Collins et al., 2014Collins J.W. Keeney K.M. Crepin V.F. Rathinam V.A.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Finlay B.B. Frankel G. Citrobacter rodentium: infection, inflammation and the microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that a microbiota deprived of dietary fiber damages the colonic mucus barrier and promotes pathogen susceptibility. Our findings suggest a mechanism through which diet alters the activity of the gut microbiota and impacts health, which is important prerequisite knowledge for rationally designing future dietary interventions and therapeutics. Diet changes are known to rapidly affect the composition of the microbiota in humans and rodents (David et al., 2014David L.A. Maurice C.F. Carmody R.N. Gootenberg D.B. Button J.E. Wolfe B.E.

USA. 2013; 110: 13582-13587Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the full complexity of the gut microbiota is a barrier to deriving detailed conclusions because sequence-based approaches (16S rRNA gene and meta-genomics\/-transcriptomics) suffer from substantial functional uncertainty. Thus, to test our hypothesis that specific members within a fiber-deprived gut microbiota cause damage by increasingly foraging for nutrients in the protective mucus layer, we designed a synthetic microbiota (SM) containing 14 species of fully sequenced commensal human gut bacteria (Figure 1A). The selected species were chosen to represent the five dominant phyla and collectively possess important core metabolic capabilities (Figure S1A).Figure S1Versatile Metabolic Abilities Contributed by Members of the Human Gut Synthetic Microbiota (SM), Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) A schematic displaying abilities of the SM to degrade a wide variety of dietary and host-derived polysaccharides and possible metabolic interactions between members of the SM.

The absorbance was measured every 10 min. See Table S1 for raw and normalized growth values and growth media descriptions for the 13 members of the SM evaluated for carbohydrate growth ability (all except D. piger). To provide an additional layer of functional knowledge about complex carbohydrate metabolism, we pre-evaluated our 14 species for growth in vitro on a panel of 42 plant- and animal-derived mono- and polysaccharides, including purified mucin O-glycans (MOGs) as sole carbon sources (Martens et al., 2011Martens E.C. Lowe E.C. Chiang H. Pudlo N.A. Wu M. McNulty N.P. Abbott D.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Gordon J.I. Recognition and degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides by two human gut symbionts.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001221Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). These growth assays allowed us to determine that all major groups of dietary fiber and host mucosal polysaccharides could be used by one or more strains in our community as well as which bacteria target each glycan (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B; Table S1). It is evident that the four mucin-degrading species fall into two categories: mucin specialists (A. muciniphila and B. intestinihominis), which only grow on MOGs as a sole polysaccharide source, and mucin generalists (B. thetaiotaomicron and B. caccae), which each grow on several other polysaccharides. Overall, our choice of species is physiologically and ecologically representative of the more complex native gut microbiota. Because our community is composed of bacteria with determined carbohydrate metabolic abilities, it allows us to address our central hypothesis in more precise, mechanistic detail. To develop a gnotobiotic model, we assembled the SM in germfree mice, which were fed a standard fiber-rich (FR) laboratory diet that contains \u223c15% dietary fiber from minimally processed grains and plants (Figures 1B and 1C). Colonized animals were maintained on the FR diet for 14 days to monitor reproducibility and stability of community assembly (Figure 1B). All of the introduced species persisted in each mouse between 6 and 54 or 66 days of colonization depending on the length of the experiment (n = 37 total, two independent experiments; analyzed by both 16S rRNA sequencing [Table S2] and qPCR approaches [Table S3]). Individual mice exhibited reproducible SM assembly irrespective of caging, mouse gender, experimental replicate, or method of analysis (Figure S2; Tables S2 and S3). In addition to 29 germfree control animals, a total of four different gnotobiotic colonization experiments (51 SM-colonized mice in total; experiments 1\u22124) were performed according to the timeline shown in Figure 1B. Although dietary changes are known to perturb microbiota composition, the impact of diet variation, especially chronic or intermittent fiber deficiency, on the activities and abundance of mucin-degrading bacterial communities has not been studied in functional detail. After validating stable SM colonization, three groups of mice were maintained by constant feeding of one of three different diets: fiber-rich (FR), fiber-free (FF), or prebiotic (Pre). In contrast to the FR diet that contained naturally milled food ingredients with intact fiber particles, the Pre diet was designed to study the effect of adding a mixture of purified, soluble glycans, similar to those used in prebiotic formulations (Figure 2C). To imitate the fact that the human diet experiences fluctuating amounts of fiber from meal-to-meal, four other groups were alternated between the FR and FF or Pre and FF diets on a daily or 4-day basis (Figure 1B). Fecal microbial community dynamics showed that in mice switched to the FF diet, several species rapidly and reproducibly changed in abundance (Figures 2A, 2B and S3). Four species\u2014A. muciniphila, B. caccae, B. ovatus, and E. rectale\u2014were highly responsive to diet change. A. muciniphila and B. caccae are able to degrade MOGs in vitro. B. ovatus and E. rectale cannot metabolize MOGs, but together can use a broad range of polysaccharides found in dietary fiber (Figure 1A). In the absence of fiber, the abundance of A. muciniphila and B. caccae increased rapidly with a corresponding decrease of the fiber-degrading species (Figure 2A). The Pre diet, which contains purified polysaccharides and is otherwise isocaloric with the FF diet, had a similar effect on community composition as the FF diet but separated slightly by PCoA ordination from FF, likely due to increased Bacteroides abundance (Figures 2A and 2B). Intriguingly, the abundances of the same four bacteria noted above fluctuated rapidly on a daily basis when the FR and FF diets were oscillated (Figures 2C and S3), corroborating their ability to respond dynamically to variations in dietary fiber. The increase in mucin-degrading species observed in fecal samples matched with cecal abundances at the end of the experiment (Figure 2D and panels to the right of plots in Figure 2A). Moreover, similar levels of mucin-degrading bacteria were quantified in the colonic lumen and mucus layer using laser capture microdissection (Figure 2E), indicating that proliferation of mucin-degrading bacteria in this model is a community-wide effect and not limited just to the mucus layer. Many of the other bacteria (except R. intestinalis and B. intestinihominis) were sensitive to changes between the FR and FF diets on daily and 4-day bases, albeit to lower degrees (Figure S3B; Table S2). Two additional species especially sensitive to diet change were Desulfovibrio piger (increased on FF diet) and Marvinbryantia formatexigens (decreased on FF diet) (Figure S3A). Population changes in the groups oscillated between Pre and FF diets were similar to the abundances observed in FF only diet regimen (Table S2). Thus, despite the pure polysaccharides contained in the Pre diet exerting a clear physiological impact on the microbiota (discussed below), the amount and composition of the purified polysaccharides in this diet exert little effect on species composition. Because mucin-degrading bacteria were higher on both the FF and Pre diets that lack naturally complex plant fiber, we reasoned that this increased abundance is due to their ability to degrade mucus as an alternative nutrient. To test this, we measured changes in transcripts encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that enable gut bacteria to utilize dietary fiber and mucosal polysaccharides (cecal samples from all but the 4-day oscillation groups were analyzed). Based on new or existing genome annotations of the 14 species in our synthetic community, a total of 1,661 different degradative CAZymes belonging to 96 different families were detected (glycoside hydrolase [GH], polysaccharide lyase [PL], and carbohydrate esterase [CE] families were counted). This number is close to the total number of families (122) that was identified in a larger survey of 177 human gut bacterial reference genomes (El Kaoutari et al., 2013El Kaoutari A. Armougom F. Gordon J.I. Raoult D. Henrissat B. The abundance and variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), indicating that our synthetic community retains much of the metabolic potential toward carbohydrates that is present in a more diverse microbiota. Of the 96 enzyme families in our community, members of 38 families, plus M60-like proteases (pfam13402), a group of enzymes previously shown to degrade mucin glycoproteins (Nakjang et al., 2012Nakjang S. Ndeh D.A. Wipat A. Bolam D.N. Hirt R.P. A novel extracellular metallopeptidase domain shared by animal host-associated mutualistic and pathogenic microbes.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e30287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), showed variable expression in either FR\/FF or Pre\/FF community transcriptome comparisons (Figure 3A). These differentially abundant degradative enzymes mapped to 770 different genes contributed from all species except D. piger (Table S4). Our transcriptomic data show that in the mice fed the FR diet, transcripts belonging to enzyme families that target dietary fiber polysaccharides were more abundant. In contrast, in mice fed the FF diet, transcripts encoding enzyme families known to release sugars from host substrates, including mucin O-glycans, were elevated (Figure 3A). In line with our in vitro growth assays (Figure 1A) and the microbial community abundance data (Figure 2), we found that B. ovatus and E. rectale contributed a majority of CAZymes specific for plant polysaccharides (Figure 3A). The four in vitro mucin degraders were the major contributors to the degradation of host glycans and mucus in vivo. Additionally, transcripts encoding M60-like proteases (pfam13402) were also more highly expressed in FF conditions (Figure 3A). Expression of these putative mucin-targeting enzymes was primarily contributed by B. caccae, an organism that possesses 16 of these genes compared to just four in A. muciniphila and five in all other species combined. This observation suggests the tantalizing possibility that B. caccae is particularly equipped via its M60-like proteases to perform a key degradative step (cleavage of glycoprotein backbones) during mucin foraging and this ability may facilitate access to mucus carbohydrate structures by other bacteria. In the group fed the Pre diet, similar transcripts as in the FR-fed group were elevated relative to FF, albeit to lower levels (Figure 3A bottom histogram). Furthermore, transcripts for the same bacterial enzymes presumed to target mucus in the FR\/FF diet comparison were observed in the Pre\/FF comparison. Additional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of cecal transcriptomes from mice oscillated between FR\/FF and Pre\/FF on a daily basis (collected after 1 day on FF diet) provided similar results to those obtained for the FF only diet mice (Table S4). Our transcriptomic readouts corroborate the increased abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria observed in these mice (Figure 2D) and demonstrate that even intermittent fiber deficiency has the potential to alter the microbiota and favor mucin-degrading species. To further connect the in vivo responses of B. caccae and A. muciniphila with degradation of mucin O-glycans, we performed additional transcriptional profiling of these two species on purified MOGs from porcine gastric mucus. We have previously shown that this mixture contains \u223c110 different structures (Hickey et al., 2015Hickey C.A. Kuhn K.A. Donermeyer D.L. Porter N.T. Jin C. Cameron E.A. Jung H. Kaiko G.E. Wegorzewska M.

Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont.Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). During growth on MOGs as the sole carbon source, B. caccae and A. muciniphila activated expression of 82 and 58 genes, respectively (Table S5). Based on a recalculation using a 5-fold cutoff of previous microarray data from growth in the same substrate, B. thetaiotaomicron activated expression of 166 genes (Martens et al., 2008Martens E.C.

Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont.Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Next, we examined expression of these validated O-glycan-responsive genes (for B. caccae, A. muciniphila, and B. thetaiotaomicron) in the SM community from FF-fed mice compared to FR. In support of our hypothesis, validated B. caccae and A. muciniphila O-glycan-responsive genes were increased in the FF condition (Figure 3B). B. caccae expression was increased irrespective of normalization by reads mapped to the whole community (i.e., including increased B. caccae abundance) or to just the B. caccae genome (discounts abundance change and examines changes in expression).

    "text":"An overview of the chemical composition of biomass. An extended overview of the chemical composition of biomass was conducted. The general considerations and some problems related to biomass and particularly the composition of this fuel are discussed. Reference peer-reviewed data for chemical composition of 86 varieties of biomass, including traditional and complete proximate, ultimate and ash analyses (21 characteristics), were used to describe the biomass system. It was shown that the chemical composition of biomass and especially ash components are highly variable due to the extremely high variations of moisture, ash yield, and different genetic types of inorganic matter in biomass. However, when the proximate and ultimate data are recalculated respectively on dry and dry ash-free basis, the characteristics show quite narrow ranges. In decreasing order of abundance, the elements in biomass are commonly C, O, H, N, Ca, K, Si, Mg, Al, S, Fe, P, Cl, Na, Mn, and Ti. It was identified that the chemical distinctions among the specified natural and anthropogenic biomass groups and sub-groups are significant and they are related to different biomass sources and origin, namely from plant and animal products or from mixtures of plant, animal, and manufacture materials. Respective chemical data for 38 solid fossil fuels were also applied as subsidiary information for clarifying the biomass composition and for comparisons. It was found that the chemical composition of natural biomass system is simpler than that of solid fossil fuels. However, the semi-biomass system is quite complicated as a result of incorporation of various non-biomass materials during biomass processing. It was identified that the biomass composition is significantly different from that of coal and the variations among biomass composition were also found to be greater than for coal. Natural biomass is: (1) highly enriched in Mn > K > P > Cl > Ca > (Mg, Na) > O > moisture > volatile matter; (2) slightly enriched in H; and (3) depleted in ash, Al, C, Fe, N, S, Si, and Ti in comparison with coal. The correlations and associations among 20 chemical characteristics are also studied to find some basic trends and important relationships occurring in the natural biomass system. As a result of that five strong and important associations, namely: (1) C\u2013H; (2) N\u2013S\u2013Cl; (3) Si\u2013Al\u2013Fe\u2013Na\u2013Ti; (4) Ca\u2013Mg\u2013Mn; and (5) K\u2013P\u2013S\u2013Cl; were identified and discussed.

The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D-Dc)\/Dc is found to scale as \u03b1S\/Eh, where \u03b1 is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element.

We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots.

In order to better understand the common features present in drug molecules, we use shape description methods to analyze a database of commercially available drugs and prepare a list of common drug shapes. A useful way of organizing this structural data is to group the atoms of each drug molecule into ring, linker, framework, and side chain atoms. On the basis of the two-dimensional molecular structures (without regard to atom type, hybridization, and bond order), there are 1179 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds analyzed. However, the shapes of half of the drugs in the database are described by the 32 most frequently occurring frameworks. This suggests that the diversity of shapes in the set of known drugs is extremely low. In our second method of analysis, in which atom type, hybridization, and bond order are considered, more diversity is seen; there are 2506 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds in the database, and the most frequently occurring 42 frameworks account for only one-fourth of the drugs. We discuss the possible interpretations of these findings and the way they may be used to guide future drug discovery research.",

Mammalian cells fuel their growth and proliferation through the catabolism of two main substrates: glucose and glutamine. Most of the remaining metabolites taken up by proliferating cells are not catabolized, but instead are used as building blocks during anabolic macromolecular synthesis. Investigations of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector AKT have confirmed that these oncogenes play a direct role in stimulating glucose uptake and metabolism, rendering the transformed cell addicted to glucose for the maintenance of survival. In contrast, less is known about the regulation of glutamine uptake and metabolism. Here, we report that the transcriptional regulatory properties of the oncogene Myc coordinate the expression of genes necessary for cells to engage in glutamine catabolism that exceeds the cellular requirement for protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. A consequence of this Myc-dependent glutaminolysis is the reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism to depend on glutamine catabolism to sustain cellular viability and TCA cycle anapleurosis. The ability of Myc-expressing cells to engage in glutaminolysis does not depend on concomitant activation of PI3K or AKT. The stimulation of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism resulted in reduced glucose carbon entering the TCA cycle and a decreased contribution of glucose to the mitochondrial-dependent synthesis of phospholipids. These data suggest that oncogenic levels of Myc induce a transcriptional program that promotes glutaminolysis and triggers cellular addiction to glutamine as a bioenergetic substrate.",

The bioactive agents may be encapsulated into the interior of the dendrimers or chemically attached\/physically adsorbed onto the dendrimer surface, with the option of tailoring the carrier to the specific needs of the active material and its therapeutic applications. In this regard, the high density of exo-presented surface groups allows attachment of targeting groups or functionality that may modify the solution behavior or toxicity of dendrimers.

The integrated model has been applied to study the feasibility and cost of carbon capture and sequestration at both new and existing coal-burning power plants. The cost of carbon avoidance was shown to depend strongly on assumptions about the reference plant design, details of the CO2 capture system design, interactions with other pollution control systems, and method of CO2 storage. The CO2 avoidance cost for retrofit systems was found to be generally higher than for new plants, mainly because of the higher energy penalty resulting from less efficient heat integration as well as site-specific difficulties typically encountered in retrofit applications. For all cases, a small reduction in CO2 capture cost was afforded by the SO2 emission trading credits generated by amine-based capture systems.

Over the past 200 years emissions of toxic heavy metals have risen tremendously and significantly exceed those from natural sources for practically all metals. Uptake and accumulation by crop plants represents the main entry pathway for potentially health-threatening toxic metals into human and animal food. Of major concern are the metalloids arsenic (As) and selenium (Se), and the metals cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). This review discusses the molecular mechanisms of toxic metal accumulation in plants and algae, the responses to metal exposure, as well as our understanding of metal tolerance and its evolution. The main emphasis will be on cadmium, which is by far the most widely studied of the non-essential toxic metals\/metalloids. Entry via Zn2+, Fe2+, and Ca2+ transporters is the molecular basis of Cd2+ uptake into plant cells. Much less is known about the partitioning of non-essential metals and about the genes underlying the enormous diversity among plants with respect to Cd accumulation in different tissues. Numerous studies have described symptoms and responses of plants upon toxic metal exposure. Mysterious are primary targets of toxicity, the degree of specificity of responses, the sensing and the signaling events that lead to transcriptional activation. All plants apparently possess a basal tolerance of toxic non-essential metals. For Cd and As, this is largely dependent on the phytochelatin pathway.

    "text":"Ecological and toxicological effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems: A global assessment. We provide a global assessment, with detailed multi-scale data, of the ecological and toxicological effects generated by inorganic nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Our synthesis of the published scientific literature shows three major environmental problems: (1) it can increase the concentration of hydrogen ions in freshwater ecosystems without much acid-neutralizing capacity, resulting in acidification of those systems; (2) it can stimulate or enhance the development, maintenance and proliferation of primary producers, resulting in eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems; (3) it can reach toxic levels that impair the ability of aquatic animals to survive, grow and reproduce. Inorganic nitrogen pollution of ground and surface waters can also induce adverse effects on human health and economy. Because reductions in SO2 emissions have reduced the atmospheric deposition of H2SO4 across large portions of North America and Europe, while emissions of NOx have gone unchecked, HNO3 is now playing an increasing role in the acidification of freshwater ecosystems. This acidification process has caused several adverse effects on primary and secondary producers, with significant biotic impoverishments, particularly concerning invertebrates and fishes, in many atmospherically acidified lakes and streams. The cultural eutrophication of freshwater, estuarine, and coastal marine ecosystems can cause ecological and toxicological effects that are either directly or indirectly related to the proliferation of primary producers. Extensive kills of both invertebrates and fishes are probably the most dramatic manifestation of hypoxia (or anoxia) in eutrophic and hypereutrophic aquatic ecosystems with low water turnover rates. The decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations can also promote the formation of reduced compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide, resulting in higher adverse (toxic) effects on aquatic animals. Additionally, the occurrence of toxic algae can significantly contribute to the extensive kills of aquatic animals. Cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and diatoms appear to be major responsible that may be stimulated by inorganic nitrogen pollution. Among the different inorganic nitrogenous compounds (NH4+, NH3, NO2-, HNO2NO3-) that aquatic animals can take up directly from the ambient water, unionized ammonia is the most toxic, while ammonium and nitrate ions are the least toxic. In general, seawater animals seem to be more tolerant to the toxicity of inorganic nitrogenous compounds than freshwater animals, probably because of the ameliorating effect of water salinity (sodium, chloride, calcium and other ions) on the tolerance of aquatic animals. Ingested nitrites and nitrates from polluted drinking waters can induce methemoglobinemia in humans, particularly in young infants, by blocking the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Ingested nitrites and nitrates also have a potential role in developing cancers of the digestive tract through their contribution to the formation of nitrosamines. In addition, some scientific evidences suggest that ingested nitrites and nitrates might result in mutagenicity, teratogenicity and birth defects, contribute to the risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and bladder and ovarian cancers, play a role in the etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in the development of thyroid hypertrophy, or cause spontaneous abortions and respiratory tract infections. Indirect health hazards can occur as a consequence of algal toxins, causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatoenteritis, muscular cramps, and several poisoning syndromes (paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning). Other indirect health hazards can also come from the potential relationship between inorganic nitrogen pollution and human infectious diseases (malaria, cholera). Human sickness and death, extensive kills of aquatic animals, and other negative effects, can have elevated costs on human economy, with the recreation and tourism industry suffering the most important economic impacts, at least locally. It is concluded that levels of total nitrogen lower than 0.5-1.0 mg TN\/L could prevent aquatic ecosystems (excluding those ecosystems with naturally high N levels) from developing acidification and eutrophication, at least by inorganic nitrogen pollution. Those relatively low TN levels could also protect aquatic animals against the toxicity of inorganic nitrogenous compounds since, in the absence of eutrophication, surface waters usually present relatively high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, most inorganic reactive nitrogen being in the form of nitrate. Additionally, human health and economy would be safer from the adverse effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution.",

It is found that the electrical characteristics of reduced GO do not approach those of intrinsic graphene obtained by mechanical cleaving because the material remains significantly oxidized.

There is growing evidence that the rate of warming is amplified with elevation, such that high-mountain environments experience more rapid changes in temperature than environments at lower elevations. Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations.",

Tumour cells evade immune surveillance by upregulating the surface expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells to elicit the immune checkpoint response1,2. Anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown remarkable promise in treating tumours, including metastatic melanoma2-4. However, the patient response rate is low4,5. A better understanding of PD-L1-mediated immune evasion is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here we report that metastatic melanomas release extracellular vesicles, mostly in the form of exosomes, that carry PD-L1 on their surface. Stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) increases the amount of PD-L1 on these vesicles, which suppresses the function of CD8 T cells and facilitates tumour growth. In patients with metastatic melanoma, the level of circulating exosomal PD-L1 positively correlates with that of IFN-\u03b3, and varies during the course of anti-PD-1 therapy. The magnitudes of the increase in circulating exosomal PD-L1 during early stages of treatment, as an indicator of the adaptive response of the tumour cells to T cell reinvigoration, stratifies clinical responders from non-responders. Our study unveils a mechanism by which tumour cells systemically suppress the immune system, and provides a rationale for the application of exosomal PD-L1 as a predictor for anti-PD-1 therapy.",

The introduction of synthetic zeolites has led to a paradigm shift in catalysis, separations, and adsorption processes, due to their unique properties such as crystallinity, high-surface area, acidity, ion-exchange capacity, and shape-selective character. However, the sole presence of micropores in these materials often imposes intracrystalline diffusion limitations, rendering low utilisation of the zeolite active volume in catalysed reactions. This critical review examines recent advances in the rapidly evolving area of zeolites with improved accessibility and molecular transport. Strategies to enhance catalyst effectiveness essentially comprise the synthesis of zeolites with wide pores and\/or with short diffusion length. Available approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality for practical implementation, establishing a firm link between the properties of the resulting materials and the catalytic function. We particularly dwell on the exciting field of hierarchical zeolites, which couple in a single material the catalytic power of micropores and the facilitated access and improved transport consequence of a complementary mesopore network. The carbon templating and desilication routes as examples of bottom-up and top-down methods, respectively, are reviewed in more detail to illustrate the benefits of hierarchical zeolites.

Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32 Pg C yr\u22121 from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr\u22121 is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally. An analysis of regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity yields a global CO2 evasion rate of 2.1 \u00d7 1015 grams of carbon per year, which is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger contribution from streams and rivers. There has been a growing recognition in recent decades that inland waters release considerable amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Until now it has been difficult to obtain global estimates of how much carbon is transferred in this way. This study combines new data sets with a systematic approach to the problem and estimates the global emission rate at about two petagrams of carbon per year from streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, which is higher than previous figures because of the contributions from streams and rivers.

The World Health Organization has recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide with potent antimalarial properties, produced by the plant Artemisia annua. However, the supply of plant-derived artemisinin is unstable, resulting in shortages and price fluctuations, complicating production planning by ACT manufacturers. A stable source of affordable artemisinin is required. Here we use synthetic biology to develop strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) for high-yielding biological production of artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin. Previous attempts to produce commercially relevant concentrations of artemisinic acid were unsuccessful, allowing production of only 1.6 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Here we demonstrate the complete biosynthetic pathway, including the discovery of a plant dehydrogenase and a second cytochrome that provide an efficient biosynthetic route to artemisinic acid, with fermentation titres of 25 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Furthermore, we have developed a practical, efficient and scalable chemical process for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin using a chemical source of singlet oxygen, thus avoiding the need for specialized photochemical equipment. The strains and processes described here form the basis of a viable industrial process for the production of semi-synthetic artemisinin to stabilize the supply of artemisinin for derivatization into active pharmaceutical ingredients (for example, artesunate) for incorporation into ACTs. Because all intellectual property rights have been provided free of charge, this technology has the potential to increase provision of first-line antimalarial treatments to the developing world at a reduced average annual price.",

Mutations in the human dynamin-related protein Drp1 cause mitochondria to form perinuclear clusters.

The increased connectivity between mitochondria indicates that the balance between mitochondrial division and fusion is shifted toward fusion. Such a shift is consistent with a block in mitochondrial division. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation show that endogenous Drp1 is localized to mitochondria, which is also consistent with a role in mitochondrial division. A direct role in mitochondrial division is suggested by time-lapse photography of transfected cells, in which green fluorescent protein fused to Drp1 is concentrated in spots that mark actual mitochondrial division events. We find that purified human Drp1 can self-assemble into multimeric ring-like structures with dimensions similar to those of dynamin multimers. The structural and functional similarities between dynamin and Drp1 suggest that Drp1 wraps around the constriction points of dividing mitochondria, analogous to dynamin collars at the necks of budding vesicles.

Despite the scientific consensus that humans have dramatically altered the global environment, we have a limited knowledge of the specific forces driving those impacts. One key limitation to a precise understanding of anthropogenic impacts is the absence of a set of refined analytic tools. Here we assess the analytic utility of the well-known IPAT identity, the newly developed ImPACT identity, and their stochastic cousin, the STIRPAT model. We discuss the relationship between these three formulations, their similar conceptual underpinnings and their divergent uses. We then refine the STIRPAT model by developing the concept of ecological elasticity (EE). To illustrate the application of STIRPAT and EE, we compute the ecological elasticities of population, affluence and other factors for cross-national emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel combustion and for the energy footprint, a composite measure comprising impacts from fossil fuel combustion, fuel wood, hydropower and nuclear power. Our findings suggest that population has a proportional effect (unitary elasticity) on CO2 emissions and the energy footprint. Affluence monotonically increases both CO2 emissions and the energy footprint. However, for the energy footprint the relationship between affluence and impact changes from inelastic to elastic as affluence increases, while for CO2 emissions the relationship changes from elastic to inelastic. Climate appears to affect both measures of impact, with tropical nations having considerably lower impact than non-tropical nations, controlling for other factors. Finally, indicators of modernization (urbanization and industrialization) are associated with high impacts. We conclude that the STIRPAT model, augmented with measures of ecological elasticity, allows for a more precise specification of the sensitivity of environmental impacts to the forces driving them. Such specifications not only inform the basic science of environmental change, but also point to the factors that may be most responsive to policy.",

In this study, we examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +\/- 90 ng\/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma half-life of 9.2 +\/- 0.6 h.

Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices that operate on the simple mechanism of adsorption of ions from an electrolyte on a high-surface-area electrode. Over the past decade, the performance of supercapacitors has greatly improved, as electrode materials have been tuned at the nanoscale and electrolytes have gained an active role, enabling more efficient storage mechanisms. In porous carbon materials with subnanometre pores, the desolvation of the ions leads to surprisingly high capacitances. Oxide materials store charge by surface redox reactions, leading to the pseudocapacitive effect. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying charge storage in these materials is important for further development of supercapacitors. Here we review recent progress, from both in situ experiments and advanced simulation techniques, in understanding the charge storage mechanism in carbon- and oxide-based supercapacitors. We also discuss the challenges that still need to be addressed for building better supercapacitors. The development of supercapacitors requires fundamental understanding of the ion adsorption and charge storage mechanism. Salanne et al. review both chemical and physical aspects of the mechanism in carbon- and oxide-based supercapacitors.",

    "text":"Unique Cellular Interaction of Silver Nanoparticles: Size-Dependent Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species. The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has created a vast array of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) which have unique physical (size, shape, crystallinity, surface charge) and chemical (surface coating, elemental composition and solubility) attributes. These physicochemical properties of ENMs can produce chemical conditions to induce a pro-oxidant environment in the cells, causing an imbalanced cellular energy system dependent on redox potential and thereby leading to adverse biological consequences, ranging from the initiation of inflammatory pathways through to cell death. The present study was designed to evaluate size-dependent cellular interactions of known biologically active silver nanoparticles (NPs, Ag-15 nm, Ag-30 nm, and Ag-55 nm). Alveolar macrophages provide the first defense and were studied for their potential role in initiating oxidative stress. Cell exposure produced morphologically abnormal sizes and adherence characteristics with significant NP uptake at high doses after 24 h. Toxicity evaluations using mitochondrial and cell membrane viability along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed. After 24 h of exposure, viability metrics significantly decreased with increasing dose (10-75 microg\/mL) of Ag-15 nm and Ag-30 nm NPs. A more than 10-fold increase of ROS levels in cells exposed to 50 microg\/mL Ag-15 nm suggests that the cytotoxicity of Ag-15 nm is likely to be mediated through oxidative stress. In addition, activation of the release of traditional inflammatory mediators were examined by measuring levels of cytokines\/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), released into the culture media. After 24 h of exposure to Ag-15 nm nanoparticles, a significant inflammatory response was observed by the release of TNF-alpha, MIP-2, and IL-1beta. However, there was no detectable level of IL-6 upon exposure to silver nanoparticles. In summary, a size-dependent toxicity was produced by silver nanoparticles, and one predominant mechanism of toxicity was found to be largely mediated through oxidative stress.",

    "text":"A comparative overview of hydrogen production processes. Abstract Climate change and fossil fuel depletion are the main reasons leading to hydrogen technology. There are many processes for hydrogen production from both conventional and alternative energy resources such as natural gas, coal, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind. In this work, a comparative overview of the major hydrogen production methods is carried out. The process descriptions along with the technical and economic aspects of 14 different production methods are discussed. An overall comparison is carried out, and the results regarding both the conventional and renewable methods are presented. The thermochemical pyrolysis and gasification are economically viable approaches providing the highest potential to become competitive on a large scale in the near future while conventional methods retain their dominant role in H2 production with costs in the range of 1.34\u20132.27\u00a0$\/kg. Biological methods appear to be a promising pathway but further research studies are needed to improve their production rates, while the low conversion efficiencies in combination with the high investment costs are the key restrictions for water-splitting technologies to compete with conventional methods. However, further development of these technologies along with significant innovations concerning H2 storage, transportation and utilization, implies the decrease of the national dependence on fossil fuel imports and green hydrogen will dominate over the traditional energy resources.",

The mutant form of the GTPase KRAS is a key driver of pancreatic cancer but remains a challenging therapeutic target. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cells, and are naturally present in the blood. Here we show that enhanced retention of exosomes, compared to liposomes, in the circulation of mice is likely due to CD47-mediated protection of exosomes from phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages. Exosomes derived from normal fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells were engineered to carry short interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA specific to oncogenic KrasG12D, a common mutation in pancreatic cancer. Compared to liposomes, the engineered exosomes (known as iExosomes) target oncogenic KRAS with an enhanced efficacy that is dependent on CD47, and is facilitated by macropinocytosis. Treatment with iExosomes suppressed cancer in multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer and significantly increased overall survival. Our results demonstrate an approach for direct and specific targeting of oncogenic KRAS in tumours using iExosomes.",

    "text":"<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i> Displays Multiple Phenotypes during Development as a Biofilm. ABSTRACT Complementary approaches were employed to characterize transitional episodes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development using direct observation and whole-cell protein analysis. Microscopy and in situ reporter gene analysis were used to directly observe changes in biofilm physiology and to act as signposts to standardize protein collection for two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis and protein identification in chemostat and continuous-culture biofilm-grown populations. Using these approaches, we characterized five stages of biofilm development: (i) reversible attachment, (ii) irreversible attachment, (iii) maturation-1, (iv) maturation-2, and (v) dispersion. Biofilm cells were shown to change regulation of motility, alginate production, and quorum sensing during the process of development. The average difference in detectable protein regulation between each of the five stages of development was 35% (approximately 525 proteins). When planktonic cells were compared with maturation-2 stage biofilm cells, more than 800 proteins were shown to have a sixfold or greater change in expression level (over 50% of the proteome). This difference was higher than when planktonic P. aeruginosa were compared with planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas putida . Las quorum sensing was shown to play no role in early biofilm development but was important in later stages. Biofilm cells in the dispersion stage were more similar to planktonic bacteria than to maturation-2 stage bacteria. These results demonstrate that P. aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during biofilm development and that knowledge of stage-specific physiology may be important in detecting and controlling biofilm growth.",

It is ubiquitously present in foods including vegetables, fruit, tea and wine as well as countless food supplements and is claimed to exert beneficial health effects. This includes protection against various diseases such as osteoporosis, certain forms of cancer, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases but also against aging. Especially the ability of quercetin to scavenge highly reactive species such as peroxynitrite and the hydroxyl radical is suggested to be involved in these possible beneficial health effects. Consequently, numerous studies have been performed to gather scientific evidence for these beneficial health claims as well as data regarding the exact mechanism of action and possible toxicological aspects of this flavonoid. The purpose of this review is to evaluate these studies in order to elucidate the possible health-beneficial effects of the antioxidant quercetin. Firstly, the definitions as well as the most important aspects regarding free radicals, antioxidants and oxidative stress will be discussed as background information. Subsequently, the mechanism by which quercetin may operate as an antioxidant (tested in vitro) as well as the potential use of this antioxidant as a nutraceutical (tested both ex vivo and in vivo) will be discussed.",

By genetically or chemically hybridizing these carrier peptides, the efficient intracellular delivery of various oligopeptides and proteins was achieved. One of the most amazing examples is the Tat-\u03b2-galactosidase fusion protein (4Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), which has a molecular mass as high as 120 kDa. Intraperitoneal injection of the protein resulted in delivery of the protein with \u03b2-galactosidase activity to various tissues in mice, including the brain. The peptide-mediated approaches would allow the incorporation of peptides containing unnatural amino acids or nonpeptide molecules such as fluorescence probes. These methods would become powerful tools not only for therapeutic purposes as an alternative to gene delivery, but also for the understanding of the mechanisms behind fundamental cellular events, such as signal transduction and gene transcription. Besides the potential of Tat-(48\u201360) as a protein carrier, the internalization mechanism of the peptide attracted our interest. For example, Tat-(48\u201360) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) is a highly basic and hydrophilic peptide, which contains 6 arginine and 2 lysine residues in its 13 amino acid residues. However, the peptide was reported to be translocated through the cell membranes in 5 min at a concentration of 0.1 \u03bcm (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Internalization of the peptide was not inhibited even at 4 \u00b0C. The peptide is less toxic to cells than other basic membrane-interacting agents. The above features suggested that the internalization mechanism of Tat-(48\u201360) was completely different from the typical transmembrane mechanisms reported so far. Questions arise as to whether such an efficient translocation is specific for Tat-(48\u201360) and Antennapedia-(43\u201358) peptides and what is the mechanism of the highly efficient internalization. Based on experiments using synthetic peptides, we suggest the possible presence of a very similar translocation mechanism to Tat-(48\u201360) present among the various arginine-rich peptides. We also suggest the possible existence of the optimum chain length of arginine peptides for the internalization. All the peptides used in this study were chemically synthesized by Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Rink amide resin as reported previously (12Futaki S. Ishikawa T. Niwa M. Kitagawa K. Yagami T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of the peptides was conducted by the treatment with 1.5 eq of 5-maleimidofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) in dimethylformamide-methanol (1:2) for 3 h followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification. The fidelity of the products was ascertained by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Carbonic anhydrase in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was simultaneously treated with fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamidocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) andN-(6-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (Dojin) (15 eq, each) at room temperature for 1 h to introduce the fluorescein and the maleimide function to the protein. After the removal of the unreacted reagents by gel-filtration on a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, the cysteine of the respective arginine-rich peptides was allowed to react with the maleimide moiety on the above fluorescein-labeled protein at room temperature for 16 h, and then the unreacted peptides were removed by gel-filtration. Based on the molecular weight estimation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, one or two molecules of basic peptides and fluorescein per protein were incorporated, respectively. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown on 60-mm dishes and incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 to \u223c70% confluence. A subculture was performed every 3\u20134 days. For each assay, 4 \u00d7 104\/ml cells were pelleted on a eight-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc) (250 \u03bcl\/well) and cultured for 16 h. After complete adhesion, the culture medium was exchanged. The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h with the fresh medium (250 \u03bcl) containing fluorescein-labeled peptides or proteins. The concentrations of the peptides and proteins were adjusted before addition to the cell based on their fluorescent intensity. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS again, and then mounted in fluorescent mounting medium containing 15 mmNaN3 (Dako). The distribution of fluorescein-labeled peptides was analyzed on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope using a 100\u00d7 oil immersion lens. Cells were grown, incubated with proteins, and fixed basically as described above. Cells were then treated with PBS containing 5 \u03bcm propidium iodide (200 \u03bcl) at room temperature for 30 min, washed four times with PBS, and mounted in glycerol:PBS (9:1) containing 1%p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Data were obtained using a confocal scanning laser microscope MRC 1024 (Bio-Rad) equipped with a 60\u00d7 oil immersion lens or LSM 510 (Zeiss) equipped with a 40\u00d7 lens. The MTT assay was conducted basically in the same manner as reported previously (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Cells (1 \u00d7 104\/well) were cultured in 96-microtiter plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of peptides (HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360): GRKKRRQRRRPPQ-amide; R9-Tat: GRRRRRRRRRPPQ-amide; HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350): TRQARRNRRRRWRERQR-amide; FHV coat-(35\u201349): RRRRNRTRRNRRRVR-amide) at 10 or 100 \u03bcm. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 24 h before addition of MTT (Sigma, 5 mg\/ml in PBS) for 4 h. The precipitated MTT formazan was dissolved overnight in 0.04 n HCl in isopropanol (100 \u03bcl). The absorbance at 570 nm was then measured. Cell viability was expressed as the ratio of the A 570 of cells treated with peptide over the control samples. To obtain insight into the translocation mechanisms of the Tat-(48\u201360) peptide, Tat-(48\u201360), its d-amino acid-substituted analog (d-Tat) and arginine-substituted analog (R9-Tat), where residues corresponding to positions 49\u201357 were replaced with arginine, were synthesized (Fig.1 a). An extra cysteine amide was incorporated into the C terminus of each peptide for the fluorescent labeling. The peptides corresponding to nuclear localization sequences (NLS) derived from simian virus 40 (13) and nucleoplasmin (14Go\u0308rlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) were also synthesized as references. Treatment of the peptides with 5-maleimidofluorescein diacetate gave the corresponding fluorescein-labeled peptides. Internalization of the peptides was monitored by fluorescence microscopic observation after a 3-h incubation of the peptides with mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells at 37 \u00b0C. As a result, d-Tat and R9-Tat were internalized into the cell as efficiently as the Tat-(48\u201360) peptides, and localization into both the cytoplasm and nucleus was observed (Fig. 2). A similar internalization of the d-amino acid analog of Tat was reported by Huq et al. (15Huq I. Ping Y.-H. Tamilarasu N. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a linear peptide corresponding to residues 37\u201372. These results would contradict the idea that a specific receptor may play a crucial role in the translocation of the Tat-(48\u201360) peptide. On the other hand, the simian virus 40-derived and nucleoplasmin-derived peptides showed a much lower degree of internalization. These NLS-derived peptides are rich in lysine. The above results suggested that arginine residues would play an important role in the translocation.Figure 2Translocation of the arginine-rich Tat-related peptides through the cell membranes. RAW264.7 cells were treated with fluorescein-labeled peptides derived from HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) (a), R9-Tat (b),d-Tat (c), and nucleoplasmin-NLS (d) (10 \u03bcm each) for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Arginine-rich basic segments are used by a variety of RNA-binding proteins to recognize specific RNA structures (16Tan R. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). If arginine in the sequence plays an important role in the translocation, peptides corresponding to these RNA-binding segments may translocate through the cell membranes. To test this hypothesis, 10 arginine-rich RNA-binding peptides bearing a C-terminal Gly-Cys-amide (Fig. 1 b) were similarly prepared, fluorescein-labeled, and applied to the macrophage cells. To our surprise, all the peptides other than the human U2AF-(142\u2013153) peptide translocated through the cell membranes and accumulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3). As judged from the fluorescent intensity, the efficiency of incorporation into the cells showed a tendency to correspond to the number of arginine residues in the sequence. Internalization activity of the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350), FHV coat-(35\u201349), HTLV-II Rex-(4\u201316), and BMV Gag-(7\u201325) peptides, which have more than seven arginine residues in their sequences, were comparable with that of the Tat-(48\u201360) peptide. Fluorescence was observed in the cells as early as 5 min after the addition of these peptides (1 \u03bcm) to the medium. Less extensive internalization was observed in the case of the \u03bb N-(1\u201322), \u03c621 N-(12\u201329), and yeast PRP6-(129\u2013144) peptides that have five arginine residues in their sequences. The fluorescent intensity in the cells treated with the former peptides (0.1 \u03bcm) was judged not to be less than that in those treated with the latter peptides (10 \u03bcm). The P22 N-(14\u201330) and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus Gag-(7\u201325) peptides that have six arginine residues showed a moderate degree of translocation. HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) is reported to translocate through the cell membranes and accumulate in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). A similar tendency was observed with the above peptides. Not only the RNA-binding peptides but also the DNA-binding peptides corresponding to the basic leucine zipper segments derived from cancer-related proteins, c-Fos and c-Jun, and the yeast transcription factor, GCN4, which were also rich in arginine (Fig. 1 c), were internalized into the cells with almost the same efficiency as that of Tat-(48\u201360) (Fig.4).Figure 4Translocation of DNA-binding peptides through the cell membranes. RAW264.7 cells were treated with the fluorescein-labeled peptides derived from human c-Jun-(252\u2013279) (a) and yeast GCN4-(231\u2013252) (b) (1 \u03bcm each) for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) was reported to induce little toxicity to HeLa cells (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Using R9-Tat, HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350), and FHV coat-(35\u201349) peptides as representatives of the above arginine-rich peptides, cytotoxicity of the peptides was investigated. Determined by the MTT assay, the above peptides did not show a significant cytotoxicity to the macrophage cells during the treatment with a peptide (10 \u03bcm) for 24 h. At 100 \u03bcm, cell viability of the cells treated with R9-Tat became 70%, whereas viability of those treated with other peptides as well as HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) was still greater than 95%. These results suggested that many of the arginine-rich peptides can be of low cytotoxicity as reported for the HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) peptide. The above experiments showed that a variety of arginine-rich RNA\/DNA-binding peptides were able to translocate through the cell membranes. Little homology in these sequences was observed, except that they all have 5\u201311 arginine residues. Moreover, thed-amino acid substituted Rev-(34\u201350) peptide (1 \u03bcm) was internalized as efficiently as thel-peptide in 3 h (data not shown). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360), R9-Tat, and FHV coat-(35\u201349) peptides in methanol were suggestive of their not having a significant secondary structure (Fig.5), whereas the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350) peptide showed a spectrum typical of an \u03b1-helical peptide. The U2AF peptide, which was only slightly internalized into the cell, showed a spectrum very similar to that of the FHV coat-(35\u201349) peptide. These results were suggestive of the absence of even a common secondary structure in the membrane-permeable peptides. When the cells were incubated with a peptide (1 \u03bcm) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, no significant decrease in fluorescent intensity in the cell was observed using the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350), and FHV coat-(35\u201349) peptides (Fig.6). These results suggested that typical endocytosis pathways so far established would not play a crucial role in the translocation of these arginine-rich peptides.Figure 6Effect of temperature on HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350) peptide internalization. The cells were incubated with the peptide (1 \u03bcm) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C or at 37 \u00b0C. In the former case, the cells were preincubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before addition of the peptide. All the following procedures were also conducted at 4 \u00b0C until the completion of the fixation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next focused on the question whether the entry of arginine-rich peptides into the cells is one-way or not. The cells were treated with the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350) peptide (1 \u03bcm) for 3 h, then the medium was exchanged with a fresh one not containing the peptide. The fluorescence intensity from the cells 1 h later was almost comparable with or only slightly less than that of the cells just before the medium exchange. However, a substantial decrease in the fluorescence intensity was recognized in the cells 6 h later, and complete disappearance of the fluorescence was observed 24 h later. To examine if the above results were due to the leakage of the peptide from the cells, the medium was analyzed by an HPLC equipped with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. No peak was detected at the retention time corresponding to the peptide; however, peaks were observed that eluted at positions identical with those of the peptide treated with trypsin (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the cells mainly resulted from the degradation of the peptides, and not from the leakage of the intact peptide. The question whether the ingested peptide had a certain effect on the cell growth was also examined. The above HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350)-treated cells were harvested 24 h later and counted. The cell number for the peptide-treated cells was comparable with that for the control cells (without peptide treatment). Thus, the peptide-ingesting cells were judged to remain viable to divide with little effect by the peptide. It would be plausible that the peptide evenly distributes in each of the daughter cells upon cell division, since significant differences in the florescence intensity were not observed among the adjoining cells 6 h later. Considering the doubling time of the cell, which was estimated to be about 18 h, a certain amount of cells must have divided within the 6 h. If the peptides would preferentially stay in one of the daughter cells upon cell division, a certain discrepancy in the fluorescence intensity will be observed among the adjacent cells. However, further study will be necessary to adequately address this question. To examine the applicability of the above basic peptides as protein carriers, we prepared basic peptide-protein conjugates. Carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) was selected as a model protein. Basic peptide-carbonic anhydrase conjugates were prepared using N-(6-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (EMCS) as a cross-linking agent (17Tachibana R. Harashima H. Shono M. Azumano M. Niwa M. Futaki S. Kiwada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). A fluorescein moiety was introduced into the protein using the fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamidocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester simultaneously with EMCS. As judged from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the conjugates, one to two molecules of the basic peptide and fluorescein moiety were introduced into a molecule of carbonic anhydrase, respectively. Carbonic anhydrase was successfully delivered into the cells with the help of the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350), FHV coat-(35\u201349), and R9-Tat peptides as efficiently as with the HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) peptide (Fig. 7 B). Accumulation of the conjugates in the cytosol and nucleus was also observed by fluorescence microscopy of the cells without fixation (Fig. 7 B). Confocal microscopic analysis of these conjugates demonstrated both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization and not just attachment to the cellular membranes (Fig. 7 C). On the other hand, fluorescein-labeled protein without a carrier peptide was located in a limited part of the cytosol (Fig. 7 C). This result suggested that the protein was captured in the endosomes and was not able to be released into the cytosol. Myoglobin (17 kDa) was also introduced into the cell with the help of these carrier peptides (data not shown). The above data strongly suggested the importance of arginine residues in the internalization. The possible existence of the unique internalization mechanism common in these arginine-rich peptides was also suggested. We then examined the effect of the number of arginine residues in the sequences. For simplification, peptides that are composed of 4\u201316 residues of arginine were prepared (Fig.1 d). To their C termini, the Gly-Cys-amide segment was also attached for the fluorescein labeling. These results are shown in Fig.8 A. Considerable difference was recognized on the translocation efficiency and intracellular localization among these peptides. R4 showed extremely low translocation activity. R6 and R8 exhibited the maximum internalization and accumulation in the nucleus. What is interesting is that the degree of internalization decreased as the chain length further increased. For the R16, internalization of the peptide was not significant. The same kind of difference was recognized in the experiments using the conjugates of carbonic anhydrase with the arginine peptides (Fig. 8 B). A similar tendency was observed on the protein delivery using R8 and R16 as the carrier molecules. Based on the confocal laser microscopic observations, the R8-carbonic anhydrase conjugate was efficiently internalized into the macrophage cells and accumulation in the nucleus was observed as was seen in the case of the HIV-1 Rev-(34\u201350) conjugate. In contrast, the R16-conjugate seemed to mainly reside on the cell membranes after a 3-h incubation with the conjugate, but significant accumulation in the nucleus was not observed. In this report, we have shown that not only Tat-(48\u201360) but also various arginine-rich peptides were able to translocate through the mouse macrophage membranes. These peptides include the d- and arginine-substituted HIV-1 Tat-(48\u201360) analogs, RNA-binding peptides derived from proteins, such as HIV-1 Rev, HTLV-II Rex, BMV Gag, and FHV coat proteins, and the DNA-binding segments from c-Fos, c-Jun, and the GCN4 proteins. There seems a common or very similar mechanism for the internalization among these peptides. The mechanism is explained neither by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis nor by receptor-mediated endocytosis because the peptides were internalized by the cell at 4 \u00b0C, and there seemed little homology both in the primary and secondary structures among these membrane-permeable peptides except that they have several arginine residues in the sequences. These results strongly suggest the possible presence of the common and undefined internalization mechanisms ubiquitously laying among the arginine-rich basic peptides. As one more new finding concerning the features of the internalization, we have shown that the number of arginine residues has a significant influence on the method of internalization and that there seems to be an optimal number of arginine residues for the internalization. There still remain questions why such efficient translocation is possible for the arginine-rich peptides. Possible hydrogen bond formation of arginine with lipid phosphates (18Calnan B.J. Tidor B. Biancalana S. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Science. 1991; 252: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) or interaction with extracellular matrices such as heparan sulfate (19Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) may be involved in the initial step during the mechanism. However, as was seen in the case of the R16peptide, it is not enough to explain the mechanism only by considering adsorption of peptides on the membranes. Tat-(48\u201360) has been reported to carry various proteins into the cells not only into cultured cells but also into the various organs of a living mouse (4Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). As the arginine-rich peptides examined here seem to have a similar ability as carriers of proteins, further study of the arginine-based peptides may result in finding peptides penetrating to some specific cells by themselves or with the help of other address peptides. The results obtained here not only shed light on the possible presence of new types of ubiquitous transmembrane mechanisms for the arginine-rich peptides, but also on the development of novel carrier molecules for the intracellular protein delivery. We are grateful to Drs. S. Tanaka and Y. Sugimoto (Kyoto University) and Professor H. Harashima (Hokkaido University) for helpful discussions.",

    "text":"The Artificial Leaf. To convert the energy of sunlight into chemical energy, the leaf splits water via the photosynthetic process to produce molecular oxygen and hydrogen, which is in a form of separated protons and electrons. The primary steps of natural photosynthesis involve the absorption of sunlight and its conversion into spatially separated electron-hole pairs. The holes of this wireless current are captured by the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) to oxidize water to oxygen. The electrons and protons produced as a byproduct of the OEC reaction are captured by ferrodoxin of photosystem I. With the aid of ferrodoxin-NADP(+) reductase, they are used to produce hydrogen in the form of NADPH. For a synthetic material to realize the solar energy conversion function of the leaf, the light-absorbing material must capture a solar photon to generate a wireless current that is harnessed by catalysts, which drive the four electron\/hole fuel-forming water-splitting reaction under benign conditions and under 1 sun (100 mW\/cm(2)) illumination. This Account describes the construction of an artificial leaf comprising earth-abundant elements by interfacing a triple junction, amorphous silicon photovoltaic with hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving catalysts made from a ternary alloy (NiMoZn) and a cobalt-phosphate cluster (Co-OEC), respectively. The latter captures the structural and functional attributes of the PSII-OEC. Similar to the PSII-OEC, the Co-OEC self-assembles upon oxidation of an earth-abundant metal ion from 2+ to 3+, may operate in natural water at room temperature, and is self-healing. The Co-OEC also activates H(2)O by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism in which the Co-OEC is increased by four hole equivalents akin to the S-state pumping of the Kok cycle of PSII. X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have established that the Co-OEC is a structural relative of Mn(3)CaO(4)-Mn cubane of the PSII-OEC, where Co replaces Mn and the cubane is extended in a corner-sharing, head-to-tail dimer. The ability to perform the oxygen-evolving reaction in water at neutral or near-neutral conditions has several consequences for the construction of the artificial leaf. The NiMoZn alloy may be used in place of Pt to generate hydrogen. To stabilize silicon in water, its surface is coated with a conducting metal oxide onto which the Co-OEC may be deposited. The net result is that immersing a triple-junction Si wafer coated with NiMoZn and Co-OEC in water and holding it up to sunlight can effect direct solar energy conversion via water splitting. By constructing a simple, stand-alone device composed of earth-abundant materials, the artificial leaf provides a means for an inexpensive and highly distributed solar-to-fuels system that employs low-cost systems engineering and manufacturing. Through this type of system, solar energy can become a viable energy supply to those in the non-legacy world.",

    "text":"Global challenges and strategies for control, conversion and utilization of CO2 for sustainable development involving energy, catalysis, adsorption and chemical processing. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for CO2 utilization include: (1) costs of CO2 capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of CO2 chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use CO2 for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use CO2 to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use CO2 as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use CO2 recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing CO2 utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without CO2 separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of CO2 selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, O2, and N2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with CO2 as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of CO2 based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use CO2 based on the unique chemical properties for CO2 to be incorporated with high \u2018atom efficiency\u2019 such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using CO2 as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use CO2 for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle CO2 as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert CO2 under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into \u201cnew fossil\u201d energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known CO2 reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using CO2 along with H2O and O2 in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of CO2 reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H2\/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a CO2 \u201cmolecular basket\u201d as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI). The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either PEI or MCM-41 alone and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances CO2 adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using CO2 and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical CO2 for extraction and for chemical processing where CO2 is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The CO2 utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input.",

The objective of this paper is to review the design considerations faced by the developers of fast pyrolysis, upgrading and utilisation processes in order to successfully implement the technologies. Aspects of design of a fast pyrolysis system include feed drying; particle size; pretreatment; reactor configuration; heat supply; heat transfer; heating rates; reaction temperature; vapour residence time; secondary cracking; char separation; ash separation; liquids collection. Each of these aspects is reviewed and discussed. A case study shows the application of the technology to waste wood and how this approach gives very good control of contaminants. Finally the problem of spillage is addressed through respirometric tests on bio-oils concluding with a summary of the potential contribution that fast pyrolysis can make to global warming.",

    "text":"Fluorescence probes used for detection of reactive oxygen species. Endogenously produced pro-oxidant reactive species are essential to life, being involved in several biological functions. However, when overproduced (e.g. due to exogenous stimulation), or when the levels of antioxidants become severely depleted, these reactive species become highly harmful, causing oxidative stress through the oxidation of biomolecules, leading to cellular damage that may become irreversible and cause cell death. The scientific research in the field of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated biological functions and\/or deleterious effects is continuously requiring new sensitive and specific tools in order to enable a deeper insight on its action mechanisms. However, reactive species present some characteristics that make them difficult to detect, namely their very short lifetime and the variety of antioxidants existing in vivo, capable of capturing these reactive species. It is, therefore, essential to develop methodologies capable of overcoming this type of obstacles. Fluorescent probes are excellent sensors of ROS due to their high sensitivity, simplicity in data collection, and high spatial resolution in microscopic imaging techniques. Hence, the main goal of the present paper is to review the fluorescence methodologies that have been used for detecting ROS in biological and non-biological media.",

    "text":"HERBIVORY AND PLANT DEFENSES IN TROPICAL FORESTS. \u25aa Abstract In this review, we discuss the ecological and evolutionary consequences of plant-herbivore interactions in tropical forests. We note first that herbivory rates are higher in tropical forests than in temperate ones and that, in contrast to leaves in temperate forests, most of the damage to tropical leaves occurs when they are young and expanding. Leaves in dry tropical forests also suffer higher rates of damage than in wet forests, and damage is greater in the understory than in the canopy. Insect herbivores, which typically have a narrow host range in the tropics, cause most of the damage to leaves and have selected for a wide variety of chemical, developmental, and phenological defenses in plants. Pathogens are less studied but cause considerable damage and, along with insect herbivores, may contribute to the maintenance of tree diversity. Folivorous mammals do less damage than insects or pathogens but have evolved to cope with the high levels of plant defenses. Leaves in tropical forests are defended by having low nutritional quality, greater toughness, and a wide variety of secondary metabolites, many of which are more common in tropical than temperate forests. Tannins, toughness, and low nutritional quality lengthen insect developmental times, making them more vulnerable to predators and parasitoids. The widespread occurrence of these defenses suggests that natural enemies are key participants in plant defenses and may have influenced the evolution of these traits. To escape damage, leaves may expand rapidly, be flushed synchronously, or be produced during the dry season when herbivores are rare. One strategy virtually limited to tropical forests is for plants to flush leaves but delay \u201cgreening\u201d them until the leaves are mature. Many of these defensive traits are correlated within species, due to physiological constraints and tradeoffs. In general, shade-tolerant species invest more in defenses than do gap-requiring ones, and species with long-lived leaves are better defended than those with short-lived leaves.",

The 20th anniversary issue of Global Environmental Change provides an important opportunity to address the core questions involved in addressing \u201cglobal environmental\u201d problems\u2014especially those related to climate change. Climate change is a global collective-action problem since all of us face the likelihood of extremely adverse outcomes that could be reduced if many participants take expensive actions. Conventional collective-action theory predicts that these problems will not be solved unless an external authority determines appropriate actions to be taken, monitors behavior, and imposes sanctions. Debating about global efforts to solve climate-change problems, however, has yet not led to an effective global treaty. Fortunately, many activities can be undertaken by multiple units at diverse scales that cumulatively make a difference. I argue that instead of focusing only on global efforts (which are indeed a necessary part of the long-term solution), it is better to encourage polycentric efforts to reduce the risks associated with the emission of greenhouse gases. Polycentric approaches facilitate achieving benefits at multiple scales as well as experimentation and learning from experience with diverse policies.",

The status of understanding of the operation of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is reviewed. Because the carrier photoexcitation recombination lengths are typically 10 nm in these disordered materials, the length scale for self-assembly must be of order 10-20 nm. Experiments have verified the existence of the BHJ nanostructure, but the morphology remains complex and a limiting factor. Three steps are required for generation of electrical power: i) absorption of photons from the sun; ii) photoinduced charge separation and the generation of mobile carriers; iii) collection of electrons and holes at opposite electrodes. The ultrafast charge transfer process arises from fundamental quantum uncertainty; mobile carriers are directly generated (electrons in the acceptor domains and holes in the donor domains) by the ultrafast charge transfer (\u224870%) with \u224830% generated by exciton diffusion to a charge separating heterojunction. Sweep-out of the mobile carriers by the internal field prior to recombination is essential for high performance. Bimolecular recombination dominates in materials where the donor and acceptor phases are pure. Impurities degrade performance by introducing Shockly-Read-Hall decay. The review concludes with a summary of the problems to be solved to achieve the predicted power conversion efficiencies of >20% for a single cell.",

We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands.

Academic, federal, and state agency representatives were in attendance.

The size of fossil fuel reserves and the dilemma that \u201cwhen non-renewable energy will be diminished\u201d is a fundamental and doubtful question that needs to be answered. This paper presents a new formula for calculating when fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted and develops an econometrics model to demonstrate the relationship between fossil fuel reserves and some main variables. The new formula is modified from the Klass model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approximately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only fossil fuel remaining after 2042. In the Econometrics model, the main exogenous variables affecting oil, coal and gas reserve trends are their consumption and respective prices between 1980 and 2006. The models for oil and gas reserves unexpectedly show a positive and significant relationship with consumption, while presenting a negative and significant relationship with price. The econometrics model for coal reserves, however, expectedly illustrates a negative and significant relationship with consumption and a positive and significant relationship with price. Consequently, huge reserves of coal and low-level coal prices in comparison to oil and gas make coal one of the main energy substitutions for oil and gas in the future, under the assumption of coal as a clean energy source.",

Abstract The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification \u2014 that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.",

    "text":"GFDL's CM2 Global Coupled Climate Models. Part I: Formulation and Simulation Characteristics. Abstract The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved. Two versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1\u00b0 in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30\u00b0 becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1\/3\u00b0 at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments. The control simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic. Both models have been used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http:\/\/nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov\/).",

The terrigenous record exhibits a well-defined period of low influx between 14.8 and 5.5 cal. ka BP associated with the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was nearly completely vegetated and supported numerous perennial lakes; an arid interval corresponding to the Younger Dryas Chronozone punctuates this humid period. The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value, which was 4.2% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.",

The cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles has been correlated with a detailed study of their endocytotic uptake using various microscopy tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal-laser-scanning microscopy (CFLSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings suggest that Au(0) nanoparticles are not cytotoxic, reduce the production of reactive oxygen and nitrite species, and do not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL1-\u03b2, making them suitable candidates for nanomedicine. AFM measurements suggest that gold nanoparticles are internalized inside the cell via a mechanism involving pinocytosis, while CFLSM and TEM studies indicate their internalization in lysosomal bodies arranged in perinuclear fashion.

The purpose of this review is to put into perspective the many health benefits of vitamin D and the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing the risk of many common and serious diseases, including some common cancers, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Numerous epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sunlight, which enhances the production of vitamin D(3) in the skin, is important in preventing many chronic diseases. Because very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, sunlight supplies most of our vitamin D requirement. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the metabolite that should be measured in the blood to determine vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in infants who are solely breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation and in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities. Vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. A new dietary source of vitamin D is orange juice fortified with vitamin D. Studies in both human and animal models add strength to the hypothesis that the unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency worldwide is a contributing factor of many chronic debilitating diseases. Greater awareness of the insidious consequences of vitamin D deficiency is needed. Annual measurement of serum 25(OH)D is a reasonable approach to monitoring for vitamin D deficiency. The recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are inadequate, and, in the absence of exposure to sunlight, a minimum of 1000 IU vitamin D\/d is required to maintain a healthy concentration of 25(OH)D in the blood.",

Despite this effort, the CVD mortality rate continues to rise. Therefore, is it possible that this failure may be due to individual variability in response to dietary recommendations? The elucidation of the structure of the human genome combined with the knowledge that nutrients are capable of modifying gene expression and genetic variability regulates how individuals respond to a diet have led to the possibility of personalized nutrition for disease prevention. While this possibility is real for the future, our current understanding of nutrient-gene interactions for CVD is limited, making personalized nutrition therapy difficult at this time.

    "text":"Biodiversity management in the face of climate change: A review of 22 years of recommendations. Abstract Climate change creates new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Species ranges and ecological dynamics are already responding to recent climate shifts, and current reserves will not continue to support all species they were designed to protect. These problems are exacerbated by other global changes. Scholarly articles recommending measures to adapt conservation to climate change have proliferated over the last 22 years. We systematically reviewed this literature to explore what potential solutions it has identified and what consensus and direction it provides to cope with climate change. Several consistent recommendations emerge for action at diverse spatial scales, requiring leadership by diverse actors. Broadly, adaptation requires improved regional institutional coordination, expanded spatial and temporal perspective, incorporation of climate change scenarios into all planning and action, and greater effort to address multiple threats and global change drivers simultaneously in ways that are responsive to and inclusive of human communities. However, in the case of many recommendations the how, by whom, and under what conditions they can be implemented is not specified. We synthesize recommendations with respect to three likely conservation pathways: regional planning; site-scale management; and modification of existing conservation plans. We identify major gaps, including the need for (1) more specific, operational examples of adaptation principles that are consistent with unavoidable uncertainty about the future; (2) a practical adaptation planning process to guide selection and integration of recommendations into existing policies and programs; and (3) greater integration of social science into an endeavor that, although dominated by ecology, increasingly recommends extension beyond reserves and into human-occupied landscapes.",

    "text":"Review and evaluation of hydrogen production methods for better sustainability. This paper examines various potential methods of hydrogen production using renewable and non-renewable sources and comparatively assesses them for environmental impact, cost, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency. The social cost of carbon concept is also included to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. Some of the potential primary energy sources considered in this study are: electrical, thermal, biochemical, photonic, electro-thermal, photo-electric, and photo-biochemical. The results show that when used as the primary energy source, photonic energy based hydrogen production (e.g., photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical method, and artificial photosynthesis) is more environmentally benign than the other selected methods in terms of emissions. Thermochemical water splitting and hybrid thermochemical cycles (e.g. Cu\u2013Cl, S\u2013I, and Mg\u2013Cl) also provide environmentally attractive results. Both photoelectrochemical method and PV electrolysis are found to be least attractive when production costs and efficiencies are considered. Therefore, increasing both energy and exergy efficiencies and decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar based hydrogen production have a potential to bring them forefront as potential options. The energy and exergy efficiency comparisons indicate the advantages of fossil fuel reforming and biomass gasification over other methods. Overall rankings show that hybrid thermochemical cycles are primarily promising candidates to produce hydrogen in an environmentally benign and cost-effective way.",

    "text":"The history of biodegradable magnesium implants: A review\u2606. Today, more than 200years after the first production of metallic magnesium by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808, biodegradable magnesium-based metal implants are currently breaking the paradigm in biomaterial science to develop only highly corrosion resistant metals. This groundbreaking approach to temporary metallic implants is one of the latest developments in biomaterials science that is being rediscovered. It is a challenging topic, and several secrets still remain that might revolutionize various biomedical implants currently in clinical use. Magnesium alloys were investigated as implant materials long ago. A very early clinical report was given in 1878 by the physician Edward C. Huse. He used magnesium wires as ligature for bleeding vessels. Magnesium alloys for clinical use were explored during the last two centuries mainly by surgeons with various clinical backgrounds, such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and general surgery. Nearly all patients benefited from the treatment with magnesium implants. Although most patients experienced subcutaneous gas cavities caused by rapid implant corrosion, most patients had no pain and almost no infections were observed during the postoperative follow-up. This review critically summarizes the in vitro and in vivo knowledge and experience that has been reported on the use of magnesium and its alloys to advance the field of biodegradable metals.",

    "text":"Twenty years of ecosystem services: How far have we come and how far do we still need to go?. It has been 20 years since two seminal publications about ecosystem services came out: an edited book by Gretchen Daily and an article in Nature by a group of ecologists and economists on the value of the world\u2019s ecosystem services. Both of these have been very highly cited and kicked off an explosion of research, policy, and applications of the idea, including the establishment of this journal. This article traces the history leading up to these publications and the subsequent debates, research, institutions, policies, on-the-ground actions, and controversies they triggered. It also explores what we have learned during this period about the key issues: from definitions to classification to valuation, from integrated modelling to public participation and communication, and the evolution of institutions and governance innovation. Finally, it provides recommendations for the future. In particular, it points to the weakness of the mainstream economic approaches to valuation, growth, and development. It concludes that the substantial contributions of ecosystem services to the sustainable wellbeing of humans and the rest of nature should be at the core of the fundamental change needed in economic theory and practice if we are to achieve a societal transformation to a sustainable and desirable future.",

    "text":"Smaller Sulfur Molecules Promise Better Lithium\u2013Sulfur Batteries. The lithium-sulfur battery holds a high theoretical energy density, 4-5 times that of today's lithium-ion batteries, yet its applications have been hindered by poor electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode and, most importantly, the rapid fading of its capacity due to the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li(2)S(n), n = 4-8). Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue, combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S(2-4) were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S(2-4) as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S(8) and S(4)(2-). Li-S batteries based on this concept exhibit unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior rate capability, which promise a practicable battery with high energy density for applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage systems.",

The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city\u2019s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city\u2019s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.",

Long-term exposure to particulate matter air pollution has been associated with increased cardiopulmonary mortality in the USA. We aimed to assess the relation between traffic-related air pollution and mortality in participants of the Netherlands Cohort study on Diet and Cancer (NLCS), an ongoing study.We investigated a random sample of 5000 people from the full cohort of the NLCS study (age 55-69 years) from 1986 to 1994. Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (black smoke and nitrogen dioxide) was estimated for the 1986 home address. Exposure was characterised with the measured regional and urban background concentration and an indicator variable for living near major roads. The association between exposure to air pollution and (cause specific) mortality was assessed with Cox's proportional hazards models, with adjustment for potential confounders.489 (11%) of 4492 people with data died during the follow-up period. Cardiopulmonary mortality was associated with living near a major road (relative risk 1.95, 95% CI 1.09-3.52) and, less consistently, with the estimated ambient background concentration (1.34, 0.68-2.64). The relative risk for living near a major road was 1.41 (0.94-2.12) for total deaths. Non-cardiopulmonary, non-lung cancer deaths were unrelated to air pollution (1.03, 0.54-1.96 for living near a major road).Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may shorten life expectancy.",

Resonant plasmonic and metamaterial structures allow for control of fundamental optical processes such as absorption, emission and refraction at the nanoscale. Considerable recent research has focused on energy absorption processes, and plasmonic nanostructures have been shown to enhance the performance of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic cells. Although reducing metallic losses is a widely sought goal in nanophotonics, the design of nanostructured 'black' super absorbers from materials comprising only lossless dielectric materials and highly reflective noble metals represents a new research direction. Here we demonstrate an ultrathin (260 nm) plasmonic super absorber consisting of a metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal stack with a nanostructured top silver film composed of crossed trapezoidal arrays. Our super absorber yields broadband and polarization-independent resonant light absorption over the entire visible spectrum (400\u2013700 nm) with an average measured absorption of 0.71 and simulated absorption of 0.85. Proposed nanostructured absorbers open a path to realize ultrathin black metamaterials based on resonant absorption. Plasmonic nanostructures and metamaterials can augment the performance of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic cells by enhancing their absorption properties.

Abstract A necessary criterion for brittle fracture in crystals is established, in terms of the spontaneous emission of dislocations from an atomically sharp cleavage crack. We have calculated the stability of a sharp crack against emission of a blunting dislocation for a number of crystals and crystal types in two dimensions and the energy to form a stable loop of dislocation from the crack tip in three dimensions. We find that contrary to previous expectations, an atomically sharp cleavage crack is stable in a wide range of crystal types, but that in the face centred cubic metals investigated, blunting reactions occur spontaneously. Of the body centred metals investigated, iron is an intermediate case between the brittle and ductile cases, and the ionic and covalent crystals investigated are all stable against dislocation emission. Qualitatively, we find that crystals whose dislocations have wide cores, and small values of the parameter \u03bcb\/\u03b3 (\u03bcb\/\u03b3\u22e67\u00b75 to 10) are ductile while crystals with narrow cores and large values of \u03bcb\/r are brittle.",

Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.",

Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2, also called Nfe2l2) is a transcription factor that regulates the cellular redox status. Nrf2 is controlled through a complex transcriptional\/epigenetic and post-translational network that ensures its activity increases during redox perturbation, inflammation, growth factor stimulation and nutrient\/energy fluxes, thereby enabling the factor to orchestrate adaptive responses to diverse forms of stress. Besides mediating stress-stimulated induction of antioxidant and detoxification genes, Nrf2 contributes to adaptation by upregulating the repair and degradation of damaged macromolecules, and by modulating intermediary metabolism. In the latter case, Nrf2 inhibits lipogenesis, supports \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, facilitates flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, and increases NADPH regeneration and purine biosynthesis; these observations suggest Nrf2 directs metabolic reprogramming during stress.",

    "text":"Beyond species: functional diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and services. 1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.",

    "text":"Synthetic polymers in the marine environment: A rapidly increasing, long-term threat. Synthetic polymers, commonly known as plastics, have been entering the marine environment in quantities paralleling their level of production over the last half century. However, in the last two decades of the 20th Century, the deposition rate accelerated past the rate of production, and plastics are now one of the most common and persistent pollutants in ocean waters and beaches worldwide. Thirty years ago the prevailing attitude of the plastic industry was that \u201cplastic litter is a very small proportion of all litter and causes no harm to the environment except as an eyesore\u201d [Derraik, J.G.B., 2002. The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 44(9), 842\u2013852]. Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25-fold, while recovery of the material remained below 5%. Between 1970 and 2003, plastics became the fastest growing segment of the US municipal waste stream, increasing nine-fold, and marine litter is now 60\u201380% plastic, reaching 90\u201395% in some areas. While undoubtedly still an eyesore, plastic debris today is having significant harmful effects on marine biota. Albatross, fulmars, shearwaters and petrels mistake floating plastics for food, and many individuals of these species are affected; in fact, 44% of all seabird species are known to ingest plastic. Sea turtles ingest plastic bags, fishing line and other plastics, as do 26 species of cetaceans. In all, 267 species of marine organisms worldwide are known to have been affected by plastic debris, a number that will increase as smaller organisms are assessed. The number of fish, birds, and mammals that succumb each year to derelict fishing nets and lines in which they become entangled cannot be reliably known; but estimates are in the millions. We divide marine plastic debris into two categories: macro, >5 mm and micro, <5 mm. While macro-debris may sometimes be traced to its origin by object identification or markings, micro-debris, consisting of particles of two main varieties, (1) fragments broken from larger objects, and (2) resin pellets and powders, the basic thermoplastic industry feedstocks, are difficult to trace. Ingestion of plastic micro-debris by filter feeders at the base of the food web is known to occur, but has not been quantified. Ingestion of degraded plastic pellets and fragments raises toxicity concerns, since plastics are known to adsorb hydrophobic pollutants. The potential bioavailability of compounds added to plastics at the time of manufacture, as well as those adsorbed from the environment are complex issues that merit more widespread investigation. The physiological effects of any bioavailable compounds desorbed from plastics by marine biota are being directly investigated, since it was found 20 years ago that the mass of ingested plastic in Great Shearwaters was positively correlated with PCBs in their fat and eggs. Colonization of plastic marine debris by sessile organisms provides a vector for transport of alien species in the ocean environment and may threaten marine biodiversity. There is also potential danger to marine ecosystems from the accumulation of plastic debris on the sea floor. The accumulation of such debris can inhibit gas exchange between the overlying waters and the pore waters of the sediments, and disrupt or smother inhabitants of the benthos. The extent of this problem and its effects have recently begun to be investigated. A little more than half of all thermoplastics will sink in seawater.",

    "text":"The Circular Economy: An Interdisciplinary Exploration of the Concept and Application in a Global Context. There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th \u2018Five Year Plan\u2019), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as \u201can economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being\u201d.",

    "text":"Post-Combustion CO<sub>2<\/sub> Capture Using Solid Sorbents: A Review. Post-combustion CO2 capture from the flue gas is one of the key technology options to reduce greenhouse gases, because this can be potentially retrofitted to the existing fleet of coal-fired power stations. Adsorption processes using solid sorbents capable of capturing CO2 from flue gas streams have shown many potential advantages, compared to other conventional CO2 capture using aqueous amine solvents. In view of this, in the past few years, several research groups have been involved in the development of new solid sorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas with superior performance and desired economics. A variety of promising sorbents such as activated carbonaceous materials, microporous\/mesoporous silica or zeolites, carbonates, and polymeric resins loaded with or without nitrogen functionality for the removal of CO2 from the flue gas streams have been reviewed. Different methods of impregnating functional groups, including grafting techniques and modifying the support materials, have been discussed to enhance the performance of the sorbents. The performance characteristics of the solid sorbents are assessed in terms of various desired attributes, such as their equilibrium adsorption capacity, selectivity, regeneration, multicycle durability, and adsorption\/desorption kinetics. The potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is also recognized to determine whether these novel materials provide better CO2 adsorption capacity under low CO2 partial pressure. A comprehensive critical review and analysis of the literature on this subject has been carried out to update the recent progress in this arena. A comparison of different solid sorbents at different stages is made. It also includes a brief review on techno-economic analysis and design aspects of sorbent bed contactor configuration. Finally, a few recommendations have been proposed for further research efforts to progress post-combustion carbon capture.",

Biomass resources include wood and wood wastes, agricultural crops and their waste byproducts, municipal solid waste, animal wastes, waste from food processing and aquatic plants and algae. Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs, including generating electricity, heating homes, fueling vehicles and providing process heat for industrial facilities. The conversion technologies for utilizing biomass can be separated into four basic categories: direct combustion processes, thermochemical processes, biochemical processes and agrochemical processes. Thermochemical conversion processes can be subdivided into gasification, pyrolysis, supercritical fluid extraction and direct liquefaction. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical process that converts biomass into liquid, charcoal and non-condensable gases, acetic acid, acetone and methanol by heating the biomass to about 750 K in the absence of air. If the purpose is to maximize the yield of liquid products resulting from biomass pyrolysis, a low temperature, high heating rate, short gas residence time process would be required. For high char production, a low temperature, low heating rate process would be chosen. If the purpose is to maximize the yield of fuel gas resulting from pyrolysis, a high temperature, low heating rate, long gas residence time process would be preferred.",

Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 \u00d7 10 15 to 1.6 \u00d7 10 15 grams).

    "text":"Fire intensity, fire severity and burn severity: a brief review and suggested usage. Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.",

The development of synthetic strategies plays a fundamental role in advancing catalysis science and practical application of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Owing to the high surface energy of single atoms, achieving the atomic dispersion of mononuclear metal precursors and stabilizing the as-formed single atoms against migration and agglomeration are key aspects in the synthesis of SACs. Several innovative synthetic strategies for SACs are summarized and highlighted through discussion of recent advances in the synthesis of SACs via wet-chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the great potential of SACs in electrochemical applications, with special emphasis on key clean energy conversion reactions including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), are presented and discussed. Further research on single-atom catalysis should focus on understanding the structure-performance relationship and catalytic mechanism at the atomic scale by employing SACs as model systems with the aid of theoretical calculation and in situ characterization technologies to achieve an atomic-economic green catalytic process. The performance and the cost of electrocatalysts play the two most vital roles in the development and application of energy conversion technologies. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are recently emerging as a new frontier in catalysis science. With maximum atom-utilization efficiency and unique properties, SACs exhibit great potential for enabling reasonable use of metal resources and achieving atomic economy.

Advanced characterization techniques are very important for the development of single-atom catalysis, which offers strong data to confirm the electronic and structural properties of SACs. Sub-angstrom-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) can be used to directly observe the distribution of single atoms and even obtain the atomic structure of SACs.39Krivanek O.L.

Therefore, when we perform AC-STEM analysis, we should ensure that test samples have great tolerance to the electron beam and take measures to mitigate the negative effect of electron beam. In addition, some foreign impurities may lead to deleterious effects on the quality of images. Warner and co-workers found that, compared with clean MoS2 surface, atomic structure and positions of Pt atoms change in contaminated carbon regions, because Pt atoms bond with the surrounding amorphous carbon, which destroys the intrinsic interactions between Pt atoms and MoS2.40Li H.

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy represents the spectral region, extending the energy above the absorption edge range from 30\u201350 eV to 1,000 eV or more. The coordination number and distance between the center atoms and neighboring atoms can be extracted via Fourier transform (FT) analysis of EXAFS spectroscopy. Wavelet transform is a perfect supplement for FT, which can discriminate the backscattering atoms even when they overlap substantially in R spaces and provide a powerful resolution in both k and R spaces.42Funke H.

An expert panel assessed inclusion criteria, outcome, and airway management. A matched concurrent census estimated a denominator of 2.9 million general anaesthetics annually.Of 184 reports meeting inclusion criteria, 133 related to general anaesthesia: 46 events per million general anaesthetics [95% confidence interval (CI) 38-54] or one per 22,000 (95% CI 1 per 26-18,000). Anaesthesia events led to 16 deaths and three episodes of persistent brain damage: a mortality rate of 5.6 per million general anaesthetics (95% CI 2.8-8.3): one per 180,000 (95% CI 1 per 352-120,000). These estimates assume that all such cases were captured. Rates of death and brain damage for different airway devices (facemask, supraglottic airway, tracheal tube) varied little. Airway management was considered good in 19% of assessable anaesthesia cases. Elements of care were judged poor in three-quarters: in only three deaths was airway management considered exclusively good.Although these data suggest the incidence of death and brain damage from airway management during general anaesthesia is low, statistical analysis of the distribution of reports suggests as few as 25% of relevant incidents may have been reported. It therefore provides an indication of the lower limit for incidence of such complications. The review of airway management indicates that in a majority of cases, there is 'room for improvement'.",

Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.",

Transformation of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) by zero-valent iron represents one of the latest innovative technologies for environmental remediation. For example, iron can be used to construct a reactive wall in the path of a contaminated groundwater plume to degrade HOCs. In this paper, an efficient method of synthesizing nanoscale (1\u2212100 nm) iron and palladized iron particles is presented. Nanoscale particles are characterized by high surface area to volume ratios and high reactivities. BET specific surface area of the synthesized metal particles is 33.5 m2\/g. In comparison, a commercially available Fe powder (<10 \u03bcm) has a specific surface area of just 0.9 m2\/g. Batch studies demonstrated that these nanoscale particles can quickly and completely dechlorinate several chlorinated aliphatic compounds and a mixture of PCBs at relatively low metal to solution ratio (2\u22125 g\/100 mL). Surface-area-normalized rate constants (KSA) are calculated to be 10\u2212100 times higher than those of commercially available iron particles. The approach presented offers unique opportunities for both fundamental research and technological applications of zero-valent metals. For example, a potential application of the nanoscale particles is to inject the metal particles directly into contaminated aquifers instead of building iron walls.",

This article discusses the practicality of replacing portland cements with alternative hydraulic cements that could result in lower total CO2 emissions per unit volume of concrete of equivalent performance. Currently, the cement industry is responding rapidly to the perceived societal need for reduced CO2 emissions by increasing the production of blended portland cements using supplementary cementitious materials that are principally derived from industrial by-products, such as blast-furnace slags and coal combustion fly ashes. However, the supplies of such by-products of suitable quality are limited. An alternative solution is to use natural pozzolans, although they must still be activated either by portland cement or lime or by alkali silicates or hydroxides, the production of all of which still involves significant CO2 emissions. Moreover, concretes based on activated pozzolans often require curing at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their field of application. The most promising alternative cementing systems for general concrete applications at ambient temperatures currently appear to be those based at least in part on calcium sulfates, the availability of which is increasing due to the widespread implementation of sulfur dioxide emission controls. These include calcium sulfoaluminate\u2013belite\u2013ferrite cements of the type developed in China under the generic name \u201cThird Cement Series\u201d (TCS) and other similar systems that make good use of the potential synergies among calcium sulfate, calcium silicate and calcium aluminate hydrates. However, a great deal more research is required to solve significant unresolved processing and reactivity questions and to establish the durability of concretes made from such cements. If we are to use these potentially more CO2-efficient technologies on a large enough scale to have a significant global impact, we will also have to develop the performance data needed to justify changes to construction codes and standards.",

Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone.

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are porous crystalline materials with tetrahedral networks that resemble those of zeolites: transition metals (Zn, Co) replace tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (for example, Si), and imidazolate links replace oxygen bridges. A striking feature of these materials is that the structure adopted by a given ZIF is determined by link-link interactions, rather than by the structure directing agents used in zeolite synthesis. As a result, systematic variations of linker substituents have yielded many different ZIFs that exhibit known or predicted zeolite topologies. The materials are chemically and thermally stable, yet have the long-sought-after design flexibility offered by functionalized organic links and a high density of transition metal ions. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of two porous ZIFs-ZIF-95 and ZIF-100-with structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites. The materials have complex cages that contain up to 264 vertices, and are constructed from as many as 7,524 atoms. As expected from the adsorption selectivity recently documented for other members of this materials family, both ZIFs selectively capture carbon dioxide from several different gas mixtures at room temperature, with ZIF-100 capable of storing 28 litres per litre of material at standard temperature and pressure.

A set of predator-free islands created by a hydroelectric impoundment in Venezuela allows a test of these competing world views. Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation.",

We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly.

The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by the warm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82% of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years.

Free-radical mechanisms have been implicated in the pathology of several human diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the superoxide radical (O2\u00b7-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are known to be generated in the brain and nervous system in vivo, and several areas of the human brain are rich in iron, which appears to be easily mobilizable in a form that can stimulate free-radical reactions. Antioxidant defenses to remove O2\u00b7- and H2O2 exist. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) remove O2\u00b7- by greatly accelerating its conversion to H2O2. Catalases in peroxisomes convert H2O2 into water and O2 and help to dispose of H2O2 generated by the action of the oxidase enzymes that are located in these organelles. Other important H2O2-removing enzymes in human cells are the glutathione peroxidases. When produced in excess, ROS can cause tissue injury. However, tissue injury can itself cause ROS generation (e.g., by causing activation of phagocytes or releasing transition metal ions from damaged cells), which may (or may not, depending on the situation) contribute to a worsening of the injury.

Both programs use a simple algorithm that fits the amplitude modulations visible in a power spectrum with a calculated contrast transfer function (CTF). The background present in the power spectrum is calculated using a low-pass filter. The background is then subtracted from the original power spectrum, allowing the fitting of only the oscillatory component of the CTF.

We tested the algorithm on images of two-dimensional crystals by comparing the results with those obtained using crystallographic methods. The images also contained contrast from carbon support film that added to the visibility of the CTF oscillations. The tests suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine the image defocus with an error of about 10nm, whereas tilt axis and tilt angle are determined with an error of about 2 degrees and 1 degrees, respectively. Further tests were performed on images of single protein particles embedded in ice that were recorded from untilted or slightly tilted specimens. The visibility of the CTF oscillations from these images was reduced due to the lack of a carbon support film. Nevertheless, the test results suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine image defocus and tilt angle with errors of about 100 nm and 6 degrees, respectively.",

A combinatorial disulfide cross-linking strategy was used to prepare a stalled complex of human immunodeficiency virus\u2013type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase with a DNA template:primer and a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and the crystal structure of the complex was determined at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms. The presence of a dideoxynucleotide at the 3\u2032-primer terminus allows capture of a state in which the substrates are poised for attack on the dNTP. Conformational changes that accompany formation of the catalytic complex produce distinct clusters of the residues that are altered in viruses resistant to nucleoside analog drugs. The positioning of these residues in the neighborhood of the dNTP helps to resolve some long-standing puzzles about the molecular basis of resistance. The resistance mutations are likely to influence binding or reactivity of the inhibitors, relative to normal dNTPs, and the clustering of the mutations correlates with the chemical structure of the drug.",

Some species of bacteria have low-permeability membrane barriers and are thereby \"intrinsically\" resistant to many antibiotics; they are selected out in the multitude of antibiotics present in the hospital environment and thus cause many hospital-acquired infections. Some strains of originally antibiotic-susceptible species may also acquire resistance through decreases in the permeability of membrane barriers. Another mechanism for preventing access of drugs to targets is the membrane-associated energy-driven efflux, which plays a major role in drug resistance, especially in combination with the permeation barrier. Recent results indicate the existence of bacterial efflux systems of extremely broad substrate specificity, in many ways reminiscent of the multidrug resistance pump of mammalian cells. One such system seems to play a major role in the intrinsic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common opportunistic pathogen. As the pharmaceutical industry succeeds in producing agents that can overcome specific mechanisms of bacterial resistance, less specific resistance mechanisms such as permeability barriers and multidrug active efflux may become increasingly significant in the clinical setting.",

The first step of this process involved the formation of Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 (or AgNO3) with ethylene glycol (EG) heated to \u223c160 \u00b0C. These Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver (formed by reducing AgNO3 with EG) because of their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants.

This review article provides an overview of the LDH synthesis methods, the LDH characterization techniques, and the recent advancement that has been achieved in oxyanion removal using LDHs, highlighting areas of consensus and currently unresolved issues. Experimental studies relating to the sorption behaviors of LDHs with various oxyanions, and the kinetic models adopted to explain the adsorption rate of oxyanions from aqueous solution onto LDHs, have been comprehensively reviewed. This review discusses several key factors such as pH, competitive anions, temperature, etc., that influence the oxyanion adsorption on LDHs. The reusability of LDHs is discussed and some mechanistic studies of oxyanion adsorption on LDHs are highlighted. The sorption capacities of LDHs for various oxyanions are also compared with those of other adsorbents. In addition, this review critically identifies the shortcomings in current research on LDHs, such as the common weaknesses in the adopted methodology, discrepancies among reported results and ambiguous conclusions. Possible improvement of LDHs and potential areas for future application of LDHs are also proposed.",

Energy-storage devices charge during low power demands and discharge during high power demands, acting as catalysts to provide energy boost. Batteries are the primary energy-storage devices in ground vehicles. Increasing the AER of vehicles by 15% almost doubles the incremental cost of the ESS.

The awareness of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in the development of new technologies with lower emissions and technologies that can accommodate capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide.

In oxy-fuel combustion, fuel is combusted in pure oxygen rather than air. This technology recycles flue gas back into the furnace to control temperature and makeup the volume of the missing N2 to ensure there is sufficient gas to maintain the temperature and heat flux profiles in the boiler. A further advantage of the technology revealed in pilot-scale tests is substantially reduced NOx emissions. For coal-fired combustion, the technology was suggested in the eighties, however, recent developments have led to a renewed interest in the technology.

This paper reviews and ranks major proposed energy-related solutions to global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy security while considering other impacts of the proposed solutions, such as on water supply, land use, wildlife, resource availability, thermal pollution, water chemical pollution, nuclear proliferation, and undernutrition. Nine electric power sources and two liquid fuel options are considered. The electricity sources include solar-photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, tidal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The liquid fuel options include corn-ethanol (E85) and cellulosic-E85. To place the electric and liquid fuel sources on an equal footing, we examine their comparative abilities to address the problems mentioned by powering new-technology vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), and flex-fuel vehicles run on E85. Twelve combinations of energy source-vehicle type are considered. Upon ranking and weighting each combination with respect to each of 11 impact categories, four clear divisions of ranking, or tiers, emerge. Tier 1 (highest-ranked) includes wind-BEVs and wind-HFCVs. Tier 2 includes CSP-BEVs, geothermal-BEVs, PV-BEVs, tidal-BEVs, and wave-BEVs. Tier 3 includes hydro-BEVs, nuclear-BEVs, and CCS-BEVs. Tier 4 includes corn- and cellulosic-E85. Wind-BEVs ranked first in seven out of 11 categories, including the two most important, mortality and climate damage reduction. Although HFCVs are much less efficient than BEVs, wind-HFCVs are still very clean and were ranked second among all combinations. Tier 2 options provide significant benefits and are recommended. Tier 3 options are less desirable. However, hydroelectricity, which was ranked ahead of coal-CCS and nuclear with respect to climate and health, is an excellent load balancer, thus recommended. The Tier 4 combinations (cellulosic- and corn-E85) were ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste. Cellulosic-E85 ranked lower than corn-E85 overall, primarily due to its potentially larger land footprint based on new data and its higher upstream air pollution emissions than corn-E85. Whereas cellulosic-E85 may cause the greatest average human mortality, nuclear-BEVs cause the greatest upper-limit mortality risk due to the expansion of plutonium separation and uranium enrichment in nuclear energy facilities worldwide. Wind-BEVs and CSP-BEVs cause the least mortality. The footprint area of wind-BEVs is 2\u20136 orders of magnitude less than that of any other option. Because of their low footprint and pollution, wind-BEVs cause the least wildlife loss. The largest consumer of water is corn-E85. The smallest are wind-, tidal-, and wave-BEVs. The US could theoretically replace all 2007 onroad vehicles with BEVs powered by 73\u2006000\u2013144\u2006000 5 MW wind turbines, less than the 300\u2006000 airplanes the US produced during World War II, reducing US CO2 by 32.5\u201332.7% and nearly eliminating 15\u2006000\/yr vehicle-related air pollution deaths in 2020. In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss, and the biofuel options provide no certain benefit and the greatest negative impacts.",

Abstract Fostering resilience in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political uncertainty and risk has captured the attention of academics and decision makers across disciplines, sectors, and scales. Resilience has become an important goal for cities, particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the majority of the world's population, and, in addition to functioning as nodes of resource consumption and as sites for innovation, have become laboratories for resilience, both in theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly literature on urban resilience and concludes that the term has not been well defined. Existing definitions are inconsistent and underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper identifies six conceptual tensions fundamental to urban resilience: (1) definition of \u2018urban\u2019; (2) understanding of system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative) conceptualizations of resilience; (4) mechanisms for system change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability; and (6) timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more conceptual clarity is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a new definition of urban resilience. This definition takes explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive and flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among, varying disciplines. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the definition might serve as a boundary object, with the acknowledgement that applying resilience in different contexts requires answering: Resilience for whom and to what? When? Where? And why?",

The sirtuin family of regulatory proteins has been implicated in various biological pathways including responses to calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Work in mice now shows that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which mediates deacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins, is induced in liver and brown adipose tissue during fasting. One of SIRT3's substrates is shown to be long-chain acyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD). Without SIRT3, LCAD becomes hyperacetylated, which diminishes its activity, and reduces fatty acid oxidation. Mice without SIRT3 have all the hallmarks of fatty acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold. These findings suggest that acetylation is a novel regulatory mechanism for fatty acid oxidation. During fasting SIRT3 is induced in liver and brown adipose tissue. One of SIRT3's substrates is shown to be long\u2013chain acyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD). Without SIRT3 LCAD becomes hyperacetylated, which diminishes its activity, and reduces fatty acid oxidation. Mice without SIRT3 have all the hallmarks of fatty acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold. Thus, acetylation is a novel regulatory mechanism for fatty acid oxidation. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. They mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses, including calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins3. Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting.",

A randomised trial was done to evaluate the impact of improved sexually transmitted disease (STD) case management at primary health care level on the incidence of HIV infection in the rural Mwanza region of Tanzania. HIV incidence was compared in six intervention communities and six pair-matched comparison communities. A random cohort of about 1000 adults aged 15-54 years from each community was surveyed at baseline and at follow-up 2 years later. Intervention consisted of establishment of an STD reference clinic, staff training, regular supply of drugs, regular supervisory visits to health facilities, and health education about STDs. 12,537 individuals were recruited. Baseline HIV prevalences were 3.8% and 4.4% in the intervention and comparison communities, respectively. At follow-up, 8845 (71%) of the cohort were seen. Of those initially seronegative, the proportions seroconverting over 2 years were 48 of 4149 (1.2%) in the intervention communities and 82 of 4400 (1.9%) in the comparison communities. HIV incidence was consistently lower in the intervention communities in all six matched pairs. Allowing for the community-randomised design and the effects of confounding factors, the estimated risk ratio was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42-0.79, p = 0.007). No change in reported sexual behaviour was observed in either group. We conclude that improved STD treatment reduced HIV incidence by about 40% in this rural population. This is the first randomised trial to demonstrate an impact of a preventive intervention on HIV incidence in a general population.",

Recent studies have provided estimates of this climate effect through correlations of air quality with meteorological variables, perturbation analyses in chemical transport models (CTMs), and CTM simulations driven by general circulation model (GCM) simulations of 21st-century climate change. We review these different approaches and their results. The future climate is expected to be more stagnant, due to a weaker global circulation and a decreasing frequency of mid-latitude cyclones. The observed correlation between surface ozone and temperature in polluted regions points to a detrimental effect of warming. Coupled GCM-CTM studies find that climate change alone will increase summertime surface ozone in polluted regions by 1-10 ppb over the coming decades, with the largest effects in urban areas and during pollution episodes. This climate penalty means that stronger emission controls will be needed to meet a given air quality standard. Higher water vapor in the future climate is expected to decrease the ozone background, so that pollution and background ozone have opposite sensitivities to climate change. The effect of climate change on particulate matter (PM) is more complicated and uncertain than for ozone. Precipitation frequency and mixing depth are important driving factors but projections for these vari- ables are often unreliable.

    "text":"Potential of Different Enzyme Immobilization Strategies to Improve Enzyme Performance. Enzyme biocatalysis plays a very relevant role in the development of many chemical industries, e.g., energy, food or fine chemistry. To achieve this goal, enzyme immobilization is a usual pre-requisite as a solution to get reusable biocatalysts and thus decrease the price of this relatively expensive compound. However, a proper immobilization technique may permit far more than to get a reusable enzyme; it may be used to improve enzyme performance by improving some enzyme limitations: enzyme purity, stability (including the possibility of enzyme reactivation), activity, specificity, selectivity, or inhibitions. Among the diverse immobilization techniques, the use of pre-existing supports to immobilize enzymes (via covalent or physical coupling) and the immobilization without supports [enzyme crosslinked aggregates (CLEAs) or crystals (CLECs)] are the most used or promising ones. This paper intends to give the advantages and disadvantages of the different existing immobilization strategies to solve the different aforementioned enzyme limitations. Moreover, the use of nanoparticles as immobilization supports is achieving an increasing importance, as the nanoparticles versatility increases and becomes more accessible to the researchers. We will also discuss here some of the advantages and drawbacks of these non porous supports compared to conventional porous supports. Although there are no universal optimal solutions for all cases, we will try to give some advice to select the optimal strategy for each particular enzyme and process, considering the enzyme properties, nature of the process and of the substrate. In some occasions the selection will be compulsory, for example due to the nature of the substrate. In other cases the optimal biocatalyst may depend on the company requirements (e.g., volumetric activity, enzyme stability, etc).",

Dendritic cells constitutively secrete a population of small (50-90 nm diameter) Ag-presenting vesicles called exosomes. When sensitized with tumor antigenic peptides, dendritic cells produce exosomes, which stimulate anti-tumor immune responses and the rejection of established tumors in mice. Using a systematic proteomic approach, we establish the first extensive protein map of a particular exosome population; 21 new exosomal proteins were thus identified. Most proteins present in exosomes are related to endocytic compartments. New exosomal residents include cytosolic proteins most likely involved in exosome biogenesis and function, mainly cytoskeleton-related (cofilin, profilin I, and elongation factor 1alpha) and intracellular membrane transport and signaling factors (such as several annexins, rab 7 and 11, rap1B, and syntenin). Importantly, we also identified a novel category of exosomal proteins related to apoptosis: thioredoxin peroxidase II, Alix, 14-3-3, and galectin-3. These findings led us to analyze possible structural relationships between exosomes and microvesicles released by apoptotic cells. We show that although they both represent secreted populations of membrane vesicles relevant to immune responses, exosomes and apoptotic vesicles are biochemically and morphologically distinct. Therefore, in addition to cytokines, dendritic cells produce a specific population of membrane vesicles, exosomes, with unique molecular composition and strong immunostimulating properties.",

In addition to currently regulated DBPs, more than 50 DBPs that rated a high priority for potential toxicity were studied. These priority DBPs included iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs), other halomethanes, a nonregulated haloacid, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, halonitromethanes, haloaldehydes, halogenated furanones, haloamides, and nonhalogenated carbonyls. The purpose of this study was to obtain quantitative occurrence information for new DBPs (beyond those currently regulated and\/or studied) for prioritizing future health effects studies. An effort was made to select plants treating water that was high in total organic carbon and\/or bromide to enable the detection of priority DBPs that contained bromine and\/or iodine. THMs and haloacetic acids (HAAs) represented the two major classes of halogenated DBPs formed on a weight basis. Haloacetaldehydes represented the third major class formed in many of the waters. In addition to obtaining quantitative occurrence data, important new information was discovered or confirmed at full-scale plants on the formation and control of DBPs with alternative disinfectants to chlorine. Although the use of alternative disinfectants (ozone, chlorine dioxide, and chloramines) minimized the formation of the four regulated THMs, trihalogenated HAAs, and total organic halogen (TOX), several priority DBPs were formed at higher levels with the alternative disinfectants as compared with chlorine. For example, the highest levels of iodinated THMs\u2500which are not part of the four regulated THMs\u2500were found at a plant that used chloramination with no prechlorination. The highest concentration of dichloroacetaldehyde was at a plant that used chloramines and ozone; however, this disinfection scheme reduced the formation of trichloro- acetaldehyde. Preozonation was found to increase the formation of trihalonitromethanes. In addition to the chlorinated furanones that have been measured previously, brominated furanones\u2500which have seldom been analyzed\u2500were detected, especially in high-bromide waters. The presence of bromide resulted in a shift to the formation of other bromine-containing DBPs not normally measured (e.g., brominated ketones, acetaldehydes, nitromethanes, acetamides). Collectively, \u223c30 and 39% of the TOX and total organic bromine, respectively, were accounted for (on a median basis) by the sum of the measured halogenated DBPs. In addition, 28 new, previously unidentified DBPs were detected. These included brominated and iodinated haloacids, a brominated ketone, and chlorinated and iodinated aldehydes.",

    "text":"Fire effects on belowground sustainability: a review and synthesis. Abstract The overall effects of fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaceous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin over-crowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C\u00a0:\u00a0N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical, biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.",

    "text":"Variations in northern vegetation activity inferred from satellite data of vegetation index during 1981 to 1999. The northern high latitudes have warmed by about 0.8\u00b0C since the early 1970s, but not all areas have warmed uniformly [Hansen et al., 1999]. There is warming in most of Eurasia, but the warming rate in the United States is smaller than in most of the world, and a slight cooling is observed in the eastern United States over the past 50 years. These changes beg the question, can we detect the biotic response to temperature changes? Here we present results from analyses of a recently developed satellite-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data set for the period July 1981 to December 1999: (1) About 61% of the total vegetated area between 40\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N in Eurasia shows a persistent increase in growing season NDVI over a broad contiguous swath of land from central Europe through Siberia to the Aldan plateau, where almost 58% (7.3\u00d7106 km2) is forests and woodlands; North America, in comparison, shows a fragmented pattern of change in smaller areas notable only in the forests of the southeast and grasslands of the upper Midwest, (2) A larger increase in growing season NDVI magnitude (12% versus 8%) and a longer active growing season (18 versus 12 days) brought about by an early spring and delayed autumn are observed in Eurasia relative to North America, (3) NDVI decreases are observed in parts of Alaska, boreal Canada, and northeastern Asia, possibly due to temperature-induced drought as these regions experienced pronounced warming without a concurrent increase in rainfall [Barber et al., 2000]. We argue that these changes in NDVI reflect changes in biological activity. Statistical analyses indicate that there is a statistically meaningful relation between changes in NDVI and land surface temperature for vegetated areas between 40\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N. That is, the temporal changes and continental differences in NDVI are consistent with ground-based measurements of temperature, an important determinant of biological activity. Together, these results suggest a photosynthetically vigorous Eurasia relative to North America during the past 2 decades, possibly driven by temperature and precipitation patterns. Our results are in broad agreement with a recent comparative analysis of 1980s and 1990s boreal and temperate forest inventory data [United Nations, 2000].",

In light of growing concerns over the implications of many conventional agricultural practices, and especially the deep tilling of soils, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), among others, has begun to promote a package of soil conserving practices under the banner of \u2018conservation agriculture\u2019. While the title might be novel, its associated practices have long been employed by farmers, and studied by social scientists seeking to understand the reasons for their adoption and non-adoption. This paper reviews and synthesizes this past research in order to identify those independent variables that regularly explain adoption, and thereby facilitate policy prescriptions to augment adoption around the world. While a disaggregated analysis of a subset of commonly used variables reveals some underlying patterns of influence, once various contextual factors (e.g. study locale or method) are controlled, the primary finding of the synthesis is that there are few if any universal variables that regularly explain the adoption of conservation agriculture across past analyses. Given the limited prospect of identifying such variables through further research, we conclude that efforts to promote conservation agriculture will have to be tailored to reflect the particular conditions of individual locales.",

Because the data have important program and policy applications, it is essential that the validity of the method be tested.The accuracy of the AMPM was evaluated by comparing reported energy intake (EI) with total energy expenditure (TEE) by using the doubly labeled water (DLW) technique.The 524 volunteers, aged 30-69 y, included an equal number of men and women recruited from the Washington, DC, area.

This model is a modified version of g sc = a 1 A h s \/c s first proposed by Ball, Woodrow & Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221-224), in which h s is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO 2 compensation point, \u0393, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of c s , while a hyperbolic function of D s for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of g sc and c i \/c s as a function of D s , where c i is the intercellular CO 2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in g sc and a hyperbolic variation in c i \/c s as a function of D s , contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, D s and c s for published responses of the leaves of several other species. Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C 3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and CO 2 concentration.

The power from sun intercepted by the earth is about 1.8 \u00d7 1011 MW, which is many times larger than the present rate of all the energy consumption. Photovoltaic technology is one of the finest ways to harness the solar power. This paper reviews the photovoltaic technology, its power generating capability, the different existing light absorbing materials used, its environmental aspect coupled with a variety of its applications. The different existing performance and reliability evaluation models, sizing and control, grid connection and distribution have also been discussed. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

In seeking greater sustainability in water resources management, wastewater is now being considered more as a resource than as a waste-a resource for water, for plant nutrients, and for energy. Energy, the primary focus of this article, can be obtained from wastewater's organic as well as from its thermal content. Also, using wastewater's nitrogen and P nutrients for plant fertilization, rather than wasting them, helps offset the high energy cost of producing synthetic fertilizers. Microbial fuel cells offer potential for direct biological conversion of wastewater's organic materials into electricity, although significant improvements are needed for this process to be competitive with anaerobic biological conversion of wastewater organics into biogas, a renewable fuel used in electricity generation. Newer membrane processes coupled with complete anaerobic treatment of wastewater offer the potential for wastewater treatment to become a net generator of energy, rather than the large energy consumer that it is today.",

    "text":"Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks as Platforms for Functional Materials. ConspectusDiscoveries of novel functional materials have played very important roles to the development of science and technologies and thus to benefit our daily life. Among the diverse materials, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials are rapidly emerging as a unique type of porous and organic\/inorganic hybrid materials which can be simply self-assembled from their corresponding inorganic metal ions\/clusters with organic linkers, and can be straightforwardly characterized by various analytical methods. In terms of porosity, they are superior to other well-known porous materials such as zeolites and carbon materials; exhibiting extremely high porosity with surface area up to 7000 m2\/g, tunable pore sizes, and metrics through the interplay of both organic and inorganic components with the pore sizes ranging from 3 to 100 \u00c5, and lowest framework density down to 0.13 g\/cm3. Such unique features have enabled metal\u2013organic frameworks to exhibit great potentials for a broad range of applications in gas storage, gas separations, enantioselective separations, heterogeneous catalysis, chemical sensing and drug delivery. On the other hand, metal\u2013organic frameworks can be also considered as organic\/inorganic self-assembled hybrid materials, we can take advantages of the physical and chemical properties of both organic and inorganic components to develop their functional optical, photonic, and magnetic materials. Furthermore, the pores within MOFs can also be utilized to encapsulate a large number of different species of diverse functions, so a variety of functional MOF\/composite materials can be readily synthesized.In this Account, we describe our recent research progress on pore and function engineering to develop functional MOF materials. We have been able to tune and optimize pore spaces, immobilize specific functional groups, and introduce chiral pore environments to target MOF materials for methane storage, light hydrocarbon separations, enantioselective recognitions, carbon dioxide capture, and separations. The intrinsic optical and photonic properties of metal ions and organic ligands, and guest molecules and\/or ions can be collaboratively assembled and\/or encapsulated into their frameworks, so we have realized a series of novel MOF materials as ratiometric luminescent thermometers, O2 sensors, white-light-emitting materials, nonlinear optical materials, two-photon pumped lasing materials, and two-photon responsive materials for 3D patterning and data storage.Thanks to the interplay of the dual functionalities of metal\u2013organic frameworks (the inherent porosity, and the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of inorganic and organic building blocks and encapsulated guest species), our research efforts have led to the development of functional MOF materials beyond our initial imaginations.",

To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped. In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape.

    "text":"The snowball Earth hypothesis: testing the limits of global change. The gradual discovery that late Neoproterozoic ice sheets extended to sea level near the equator poses a palaeoenvironmental conundrum. Was the Earth's orbital obliquity > 60\u00b0 (making the tropics colder than the poles) for 4.0 billion years following the lunar-forming impact, or did climate cool globally for some reason to the point at which runaway ice-albedo feedback created a `snowball' Earth? The high-obliquity hypothesis does not account for major features of the Neoproterozoic glacial record such as the abrupt onsets and terminations of discrete glacial events, their close association with large (> 10\u2030) negative \u03b413C shifts in seawater proxies, the deposition of strange carbonate layers (`cap carbonates') globally during post-glacial sea-level rise, and the return of large sedimentary iron formations, after a 1.1 billion year hiatus, exclusively during glacial events. A snowball event, on the other hand, should begin and end abruptly, particularly at lower latitudes. It should last for millions of years, because outgassing must amass an intense greenhouse in order to overcome the ice albedo. A largely ice-covered ocean should become anoxic and reduced iron should be widely transported in solution and precipitated as iron formation wherever oxygenic photosynthesis occurred, or upon deglaciation. The intense greenhouse ensures a transient post-glacial regime of enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering, which should drive a flux of alkalinity that could quantitatively account for the world-wide occurrence of cap carbonates. The resulting high rates of carbonate sedimentation, coupled with the kinetic isotope effect of transferring the CO2 burden to the ocean, should drive down the \u03b413C of seawater, as is observed. If cap carbonates are the `smoke' of a snowball Earth, what was the `gun'? In proposing the original Neoproterozoic snowball Earth hypothesis, Joe Kirschvink postulated that an unusual preponderance of land masses in the middle and low latitudes, consistent with palaeomagnetic evidence, set the stage for snowball events by raising the planetary albedo. Others had pointed out that silicate weathering would most likely be enhanced if many continents were in the tropics, resulting in lower atmospheric CO2 and a colder climate. Negative \u03b413C shifts of 10\u201320\u2030 precede glaciation in many regions, giving rise to speculation that the climate was destabilized by a growing dependency on greenhouse methane, stemming ultimately from the same unusual continental distribution. Given the existing palaeomagnetic, geochemical and geological evidence for late Neoproterozoic climatic shocks without parallel in the Phanerozoic, it seems inevitable that the history of life was impacted, perhaps profoundly so.",

    "text":"The influence of soil properties on the structure of bacterial and fungal communities across land-use types. Land-use change can have significant impacts on soil conditions and microbial communities are likely to respond to these changes. However, such responses are poorly characterized as few studies have examined how specific changes in edaphic characteristics do, or do not, influence the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities across land-use types. Soil samples were collected from four replicated (n = 3) land-use types (hardwood and pine forests, cultivated and livestock pasture lands) in the southeastern US to assess the effects of land-use change on microbial community structure and distribution. We used quantitative PCR to estimate bacterial\u2013fungal ratios and clone libraries targeting small-subunit rRNA genes to independently characterize the bacterial and fungal communities. Although some soil properties (soil texture and nutrient status) did significantly differ across land-use types, other edaphic factors (e.g., pH) did not vary consistently with land-use. Bacterial\u2013fungal ratios were not significantly different across the land-uses and distinct land-use types did not necessarily harbor distinct soil fungal or bacterial communities. Rather, the composition of bacterial and fungal communities was most strongly correlated with specific soil properties. Soil pH was the best predictor of bacterial community composition across this landscape while fungal community composition was most closely associated with changes in soil nutrient status. Together these results suggest that specific changes in edaphic properties, not necessarily land-use type itself, may best predict shifts in microbial community composition across a given landscape. In addition, our results demonstrate the utility of using sequence-based approaches to concurrently analyze bacterial and fungal communities as such analyses provide detailed phylogenetic information on individual communities and permit the robust assessment of the biogeographical patterns exhibited by soil microbial communities.",

We identified independent prognosticators of survival and derived a multivariable, weighted risk formula for clinical use.

In this paper we critically examine the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). It proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita, so that, eventually, growth reduces the environmental impact of economic activity. The concept is dependent on a model of the economy in which there is no feedback from the quality of the environment to production possibilities, and in which trade has a neutral effect on environmental degradation. The actual violation of these assumptions gives rise to fundamental problems in estimating the parameters of an EKC. The paper identifies other econometric problems with estimates of the EKC, and reviews a number of empirical studies. The inference from some such EKC estimates that further development will reduce environmental degradation is dependent on the assumption that world per capita income is normally distributed when in fact median income is far below mean income. We carry out simulations combining EKC estimates from the literature with World Bank forecasts for economic growth for individual countries, aggregating over countries to derive the global impact.

In this review, we summarize the evidence from epidemiological studies on long-term exposure to fine and coarse particles, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and elemental carbon on mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. We also summarize the findings on potentially susceptible subgroups across studies. We identified studies through a search in the databases Medline and Scopus and previous reviews until January 2013 and performed a meta-analysis if more than five studies were available for the same exposure metric. There is a significant number of new studies on long-term air pollution exposure, covering a wider geographic area, including Asia. These recent studies support associations found in previous cohort studies on PM2.5. The pooled effect estimate expressed as excess risk per 10 \u03bcg\/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was 6% (95% CI 4, 8%) for all-cause and 11% (95% CI 5, 16%) for cardiovascular mortality. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 was more associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease (particularly ischemic heart disease) than from non-malignant respiratory diseases (pooled estimate 3% (95% CI \u22126, 13%)). Significant heterogeneity in PM2.5 effect estimates was found across studies, likely related to differences in particle composition, infiltration of particles indoors, population characteristics and methodological differences in exposure assessment and confounder control. All-cause mortality was significantly associated with elemental carbon (pooled estimate per 1 \u03bcg\/m3 6% (95% CI 5, 7%)) and NO2 (pooled estimate per 10 \u03bcg\/m3 5% (95% CI 3, 8%)), both markers of combustion sources. There was little evidence for an association between long term coarse particulate matter exposure and mortality, possibly due to the small number of studies and limitations in exposure assessment. Across studies, there was little evidence for a stronger association among women compared to men. In subjects with lower education and obese subjects a larger effect estimate for mortality related to fine PM was found, though the evidence for differences related to education has been weakened in more recent studies.",

Induction of genes involved in the activation and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids indicated that fatty acids furnish carbon and energy. Induction of \u03c3E-dependent, sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013regulated genes and genes involved in mycolic acid modification pointed to damage and repair of the cell envelope. Sentinel genes within the intraphagosomal transcriptome were induced similarly by MTB in the lungs of mice. The microbial transcriptome thus served as a bioprobe of the MTB phagosomal environment, showing it to be nitrosative, oxidative, functionally hypoxic, carbohydrate poor, and capable of perturbing the pathogen's cell envelope.",

Roots experiencing nutrient-rich patches can also enhance their physiological ion-uptake capacities compared with roots of the same plant outside the patch zone. These plastic responses by the root system have been proposed as the major mechanism by which plants cope with the naturally occurring heterogeneous supplies of nutrients in soil. Various attempts to predict how contrasting species will respond to patches have been made based on specific root length (SRL), root demography and biomass allocation within the patch zone. No one criterion has proved definitive. Actually demonstrating that root proliferation is beneficial to the plant, especially in terms of nitrogen capture from patches, has also proved troublesome. Yet by growing plants under more realistic conditions, such as in interspecific plant competition, and with a complex organic patch, a direct benefit can be demonstrated. Thus, as highlighted in this review, the environmental context in which the root response is expressed is as important as the magnitude of the response itself.",

    "text":"Economic Development and Environmental Quality: An Econometric Analysis. THE RELATIONSHIP between economic growth and environmental quality has been a source of great controversy for a very long time. At one extreme has been the view that greater economic activity inevitably leads to environmental degradation and ultimately to possible economic and ecological collapse. At the other extreme is the view that those environmental problems worth solving will be addressed more or less automatically as a consequence of economic growth. The longevity and passion of this debate has, in part, been a reflection of the lack of substantial empirical evidence on how environmental quality changes at different income levels. Compilation of such evidence has been constrained by the absence of data for a large number of countries. While data remain a problem, the situation is much improved and this paper takes a first step at systematic analysis of what data are available (see Appendix I for details). A number of caveats are in order. The data on environmental quality are patchy at best, but are likely to improve over time with better monitoring. Comparability across countries is affected by definitional differences and by inaccuracies and unrepresentative measurement sites. At this stage of knowledge, this paper has the modest objective of opening up the empirical debate using a relatively simple modeling technique applied on a consistent basis to a large number of environmental quality indicators and countries. The relationship between income and the costs and benefits associated with any given level of environmental quality is complex because it operates through a number of different channels, such as preferences, technology, and economic structure. The types of environmental degradation that occur depend on the composition of output, which changes with income. Some income levels are often associated with increases in certain polluting activities such as the development of heavy industry whereas economies with large service sectors may generate less pollution. There is a view that rising incomes imply that the cost of environmental degradation is greater because the wages used to value the opportunity cost of illness or work days lost are higher. This would imply increases in marginal benefits as incomes rise. But the poor are often the most exposed and vulnerable to the health and productivity losses associated with a degraded environment. There are some environmental problems where thresholds like survival are at stake. Here, the willingness to pay to avert damage is close to infinity and the level of per capita income only affects the capacity, not the willingness, to pay. With other environmental issues, most of",

Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, and it is an important greenhouse gas, which has so far contributed an estimated 20% of postindustrial global warming. A great deal of biogeochemical research has focused on the causes and effects of the variation in global fluxes of methane throughout earth's history, but the underlying microbial processes and their key agents remain poorly understood. This is a disturbing knowledge gap because 85% of the annual global methane production and about 60% of its consumption are based on microbial processes. Only three key functional groups of microorganisms of limited diversity regulate the fluxes of methane on earth, namely the aerobic methanotrophic bacteria, the methanogenic archaea, and their close relatives, the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME). The ANME represent special lines of descent within the Euryarchaeota and appear to gain energy exclusively from the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), with sulfate as the final electron acceptor according to the net reaction: [Formula: see text] This review summarizes what is known and unknown about AOM on earth and its key catalysts, the ANME clades and their bacterial partners.",

The human imprint on the global environment has now become so large and active that it rivals some of the great forces of Nature in its impact on the functioning of the Earth system. Although global-scale human influence on the environment has been recognized since the 1800s, the term Anthropocene , introduced about a decade ago, has only recently become widely, but informally, used in the global change research community. However, the term has yet to be accepted formally as a new geological epoch or era in Earth history. In this paper, we put forward the case for formally recognizing the Anthropocene as a new epoch in Earth history, arguing that the advent of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 provides a logical start date for the new epoch. We then explore recent trends in the evolution of the Anthropocene as humanity proceeds into the twenty-first century, focusing on the profound changes to our relationship with the rest of the living world and on early attempts and proposals for managing our relationship with the large geophysical cycles that drive the Earth\u2019s climate system.",

Abstract Fossil fuel consumption in transportation system and energy-intensive sectors as the principal pillar of civilization is associated with progressive release of greenhouse gases. Hydrogen as a promising energy carrier is a perfect candidate to supply the energy demand of the world and concomitantly reduce toxic emissions. This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art hydrogen production technologies using renewable and sustainable energy resources. Hydrogen from supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is the most cost effective thermochemical process. Highly moisturized biomass is utilized directly in SCWG without any high cost drying process. In SCWG, hydrogen is produced at high pressure and small amount of energy is required to pressurize hydrogen in the storage tank. Tar and char formation decreases drastically in biomass SCWG. The low efficiency of solar to hydrogen system as well as expensive photovoltaic cell are the most important barriers for the widespread commercial development of solar-based hydrogen production. Since electricity costs play a crucial role on the final hydrogen price, to generate carbon free hydrogen from solar and wind energy at a competitive price with fossil fuels, the electrical energy cost should be four times less than commercial electricity prices.",

The vast non-coding portion of the human genome is full of functional elements and disease-causing regulatory variants. The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown. Promoters and distal elements can engage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation1. Here we have applied chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C2) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites (TSSs) and distal elements in 1% of the human genome representing the ENCODE pilot project regions3. 5C maps were generated for GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the ENCODE consortium4.

Long-range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located \u223c120 kilobases upstream of the TSS. Long-range interactions are often not blocked by sites bound by CTCF and cohesin, indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains. Furthermore, only \u223c7% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions.

    "text":"The diffusion and trapping of hydrogen in steel. The mobility of dissolved hydrogen in an iron lattice having a population of extraordinary, or trapping, sites for hydrogen is analyzed under the assumption of local equilibrium between the mobile and the trapped populations. It is shown that at low coverage of the trapping sites the usual solutions of the diffusion equations can be used to analyze the experimental results and that the effective diffusivity is a function of trap density and of the magnitude of the trap depth. In the domain of coverage in which the activity of trapped hydrogen is not linear in the fractional occupation of the trap population, the concept of phenomenological diffusivity becomes non-operational and the diffusion equation must be solved with terms for sources and sinks, as done by McNabb and Foster. Values for trap number and depth are obtained by applying the relevant equations to selected data on a variety of steels with and without cold work. The results lead to the suggestion that in the absence of cold work the solid-solid interfaces are as or more important than dislocations as loci of trapping sites, and that in cold-worked steels, microcrack surfaces are more important than dislocations for hydrogen trapping.

The rhizosphere is a critical interface supporting the exchange of resources between plants and their associated soil environment. Rhizosphere microbial diversity is influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere, some of which are determined by the genetics of the host plant. However, within a plant species, the impact of genetic variation on the composition of the microbiota is poorly understood. Here, we characterized the rhizosphere bacterial diversity of 27 modern maize inbreds possessing exceptional genetic diversity grown under field conditions. Randomized and replicated plots of the inbreds were planted in five field environments in three states, each with unique soils and management conditions. Using pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we observed substantial variation in bacterial richness, diversity, and relative abundances of taxa between bulk soil and the maize rhizosphere, as well as between fields. The rhizospheres from maize inbreds exhibited both a small but significant proportion of heritable variation in total bacterial diversity across fields, and substantially more heritable variation between replicates of the inbreds within each field. The results of this study should facilitate expanded studies to identify robust heritable plant\u2013microbe interactions at the level of individual polymorphisms by genome wide association, so that plant-microbiome interactions can ultimately be incorporated into plant breeding.",

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently attracted broad research interest as they combine the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed atomic transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure determination allows density functional theoretical prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni > Co > Fe, which is confirmed by electrochemical measurements. Determination of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a critical step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts are of increasing importance in many catalytic processes, but clear structural identification is challenging.

Abstract The objective of this research is to develop a global remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) algorithm based on Cleugh et al.'s [Cleugh, H.A., R. Leuning, Q. Mu, S.W. Running (2007) Regional evaporation estimates from flux tower and MODIS satellite data.

Our algorithm considers both the surface energy partitioning process and environmental constraints on ET. We use ground-based meteorological observations and remote sensing data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate global ET by (1) adding vapor pressure deficit and minimum air temperature constraints on stomatal conductance; (2) using leaf area index as a scalar for estimating canopy conductance; (3) replacing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with the Enhanced Vegetation Index thereby also changing the equation for calculation of the vegetation cover fraction (FC); and (4) adding a calculation of soil evaporation to the previously proposed RS-PM method. We evaluate our algorithm using ET observations at 19 AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux towers. We calculated ET with both our Revised RS-PM algorithm and the RS-PM algorithm using Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO v. 4.0.0) meteorological data and compared the resulting ET estimates with observations. Results indicate that our Revised RS-PM algorithm substantially reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the 8-day latent heat flux (LE) averaged over the 19 towers from 64.6\u00a0W\/m2 (RS-PM algorithm) to 27.3\u00a0W\/m2 (Revised RS-PM) with tower meteorological data, and from 71.9\u00a0W\/m2 to 29.5\u00a0W\/m2 with GMAO meteorological data. The average LE bias of the tower-driven LE estimates to the LE observations changed from 39.9\u00a0W\/m2 to \u2212\u00a05.8\u00a0W\/m2 and from 48.2\u00a0W\/m2 to \u2212\u00a01.3\u00a0W\/m2 driven by GMAO data. The correlation coefficients increased slightly from 0.70 to 0.76 with the use of tower meteorological data. We then apply our Revised RS-PM algorithm to the globe using 0.05\u00b0 MODIS remote sensing data and reanalysis meteorological data to obtain the annual global ET (MODIS ET) for 2001. As expected, the spatial pattern of the MODIS ET agrees well with that of the MODIS global terrestrial gross and net primary production (MOD17 GPP\/NPP), with the highest ET over tropical forests and the lowest ET values in dry areas with short growing seasons. This MODIS ET product provides critical information on the regional and global water cycle and resulting environment changes.",

They are effective in removing a broad range of impurities from water, including colloidal particles and dissolved organic substances. Their mode of action is generally explained in terms of two distinct mechanisms: charge neutralisation of negatively charged colloids by cationic hydrolysis products and incorporation of impurities in an amorphous hydroxide precipitate (\u2018sweep flocculation\u2019). The relative importance of these mechanisms depends on factors such as pH and coagulant dosage. Alternative coagulants, based on prehydrolysed forms of aluminium and iron, are more effective than the traditional additives in many cases, but their mode of action is not completely understood, especially with regard to the role of charge neutralisation and hydroxide precipitation. Some basic features of metal hydrolysis and precipitate formation are briefly reviewed and the action of hydrolysing coagulants is then discussed, with examples from the older literature and from some recent studies on model systems. Dynamic monitoring of floc formation and breakage can give useful insights into the underlying mechanisms. Although the results can be reasonably well explained in terms of established ideas, a detailed understanding of the \u2018sweep flocculation\u2019 mechanism is not yet available. There are also still some uncertainties regarding the action of pre-hydrolysed coagulants.",

This research tests the interrelationship between the variables using the bounds testing to cointegration procedure. The bounds test results indicate that there exist two forms of long-run relationships between the variables. In the case of first form of long-run relationship, carbon emissions are determined by energy consumption, income and foreign trade. In the case of second long-run relationship, income is determined by carbon emissions, energy consumption and foreign trade. An augmented form of Granger causality analysis is conducted amongst the variables. The long-run relationship of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, income and foreign trade equation is also checked for the parameter stability. The empirical results suggest that income is the most significant variable in explaining the carbon emissions in Turkey which is followed by energy consumption and foreign trade.

To limit global warming to a rise of 2 \u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels, we cannot use all of our fossil fuel reserves; here an integrated assessment model shows that this temperature limit implies that we must leave unused a third of our oil reserves, half of our gas reserves and over 80 per cent of our coal reserves during the next 40 years, and indicates where these are geographically located. If global warming is to be limited in this century to the much-publicized 2 \u00b0C rise compared to pre-industrial levels, fossil fuel use and the associated release of greenhouse gases will need to be severely limited. This raises questions regarding the specific quantities and locations of oil, gas and coal that can be safely exploited. Christophe McGlade and Paul Ekins use an integrated assessment model to explore the implications of the 2 \u00b0C warming limit for different regions' fossil fuel production. They find that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain unused during the next 40 years in order to meet the 2 \u00b0C target and that the development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incompatible with efforts to limit climate change. Policy makers have generally agreed that the average global temperature rise caused by greenhouse gas emissions should not exceed 2 \u00b0C above the average global temperature of pre-industrial times1. It has been estimated that to have at least a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 \u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emissions between 2011 and 2050 need to be limited to around 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2)2,3. However, the greenhouse gas emissions contained in present estimates of global fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this2,4, and so the unabated use of all current fossil fuel reserves is incompatible with a warming limit of 2 \u00b0C. Here we use a single integrated assessment model that contains estimates of the quantities, locations and nature of the world\u2019s oil, gas and coal reserves and resources, and which is shown to be consistent with a wide variety of modelling approaches with different assumptions5, to explore the implications of this emissions limit for fossil fuel production in different regions. Our results suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80 per cent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 \u00b0C. We show that development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 \u00b0C. Our results show that policy makers\u2019 instincts to exploit rapidly and completely their territorial fossil fuels are, in aggregate, inconsistent with their commitments to this temperature limit. Implementation of this policy commitment would also render unnecessary continued substantial expenditure on fossil fuel exploration, because any new discoveries could not lead to increased aggregate production.",

    "text":"Adaptation to Sun and Shade: a Whole-Plant Perspective. Whole-plant energy capture depends not only on the photosynthetic response of individual leaves, but also on their integration into an effective canopy, and on the costs of producing and maintaining their photosynthetic capacity. This paper explores adaptation to irradiance level in this context, focusing on traits whose significance would be elusive if considered in terms of their impact at the leaf level alone. I review traditional approaches used to demonstrate or suggest adaptation to irradiance level, and outline three energetic tradeoffs likely to shape such adaptation, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and biotic interactions. Recent models using these tradeoffs to account for trends in leaf nitrogen content, stornatal conductance, phyllotaxis, and defensive allocations in sun v. shade are evaluated. A re-evaluation of the classic study of acclimation of the photosynthetic light response in Atriplex, crucial to interpreting adaptation to irradiance in many traits, shows that it does not completely support the central dogma of adaptation to sun v. shade unless the results are analysed in terms of whole-plant energy capture. Calculations for Liriodendron show that the traditional light compensation point has little meaning for net carbon gain, and that the effective compensation point is profoundly influenced by the costs of night leaf respiration, leaf construction, and the construction of associated support and root tissue. The costs of support tissue are especially important, raising the effective compensation point by 140 \ufffdmol m-2 s-1 in trees 1 m tall, and by nearly 1350 \ufffdmol m-2 s-1 in trees 30 m tall. Effective compensation points give maximum tree heights as a function of irradiance, and shade tolerance as a function of tree height; calculations of maximum permissible height in Liriodendron correspond roughly with the height of the tallest known individual. Finally, new models for the evolution of canopy width\/height ratio in response to irradiance and coverage within a tree stratum, and for the evolution of mottled leaves as a defensive measure in understory herbs, are outlined.",

    "text":"Gold Nanocages: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications. Noble-metal nanocages comprise a novel class of nanostructures possessing hollow interiors and porous walls. They are prepared using a remarkably simple galvanic replacement reaction between solutions containing metal precursor salts and Ag nanostructures prepared through polyol reduction. The electrochemical potential difference between the two species drives the reaction, with the reduced metal depositing on the surface of the Ag nanostructure. In our most studied example, involving HAuCl4 as the metal precursor, the resultant Au is deposited epitaxially on the surface of the Ag nanocubes, adopting their underlying cubic form. Concurrent with this deposition, the interior Ag is oxidized and removed, together with alloying and dealloying, to produce hollow and, eventually, porous structures that we commonly refer to as Au nanocages. This approach is versatile, with a wide range of morphologies (e.g., nanorings, prism-shaped nanoboxes, nanotubes, and multiple-walled nanoshells or nanotubes) available upon changing the shape of the initial Ag template. In addition to Au-based structures, switching the metal salt precursors to Na2PtCl4 and Na2PdCl4 allows for the preparation of Pt- and Pd-containing hollow nanostructures, respectively. We have found that changing the amount of metal precursor added to the suspension of Ag nanocubes is a simple means of tuning both the composition and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the metal nanocages. Using this approach, we are developing structures for biomedical and catalytic applications. Because discrete dipole approximations predicted that the Au nanocages would have large absorption cross-sections and because their LSPR can be tuned into the near-infrared (where the attenuation of light by blood and soft tissue is greatly reduced), they are attractive materials for biomedical applications in which the selective absorption of light at great depths is desirable. For example, we have explored their use as contrast enhancement agents for both optical coherence tomography and photoacoustic tomography, with improved performance observed in each case. Because the Au nanocages have large absorption cross-sections, they are also effective photothermal transducers; thus, they might provide a therapeutic effect through selective hyperthermia-induced killing of targeted cancer cells. Our studies in vitro have illustrated the feasibility of applying this technique as a less-invasive form of cancer treatment.",

    "text":"Mycorrhizas and nutrient cycling in ecosystems \u2013 a journey towards relevance?. Progress towards understanding the extent to which mycorrhizal fungi are involved in the mobilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from natural substrates is reviewed here. While mycorrhiza research has emphasized the role of the symbiosis in facilitation of capture of these nutrients in ionic form, attention has shifted since the mid-1980s to analysing the mycorrhizal fungal abilities to release N and P from the detrital materials of microbial faunal and plant origins, which are the primary sources of these elements in terrestrial ecosystems. Ericoid, and some ectomycorrhizal fungi have the potential to be directly involved in attack both on structural polymers, which may render nutrients inaccessible, and in mobilization of N and P from the organic polymers in which they are sequestered. The advantages to the plant of achieving intervention in the microbial mobilization\u2013immobilization cycles are stressed. While the new approaches may initially lack the precision achieved in studies of readily characterized ionic forms of N and P, they do provide insights of greater ecological relevance. The results support the hypothesis that selection has favoured ericoid and ectomycorrhizal systems with well developed saprotrophic capabilities in those ecosystems characterized by retention of N and P as organic complexes in the soil. The need for further investigation of the abilities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to intervene in nutrient mobilization processes is stressed.",

    "text":"Power plant post-combustion carbon dioxide capture: An opportunity for membranes. Abstract Carbon dioxide capture from power plant flue gas and subsequent sequestration is expected to play a key role in mitigating global climate change. Conventional amine technologies being considered for separating CO 2 from flue gas are costly, energy intensive, and if implemented, would result in large increases in the cost of producing electricity. Membranes offer potential as an energy-efficient, low-cost CO 2 capture option. Recently, working with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), we have developed membranes with CO 2 permeances of greater than 1000\u00a0gpu and a CO 2 \/N 2 selectivity of 50 at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. This permeance is ten times higher than commercial CO 2 membranes and the selectivity is among the highest reported for non-facilitated transport materials. These membranes, in combination with a novel process design that uses incoming combustion air as a sweep gas to generate driving force, could meet DOE CO 2 capture cost targets. Under these conditions, improving membrane permeance is more important than increasing selectivity to further reduce the cost of CO 2 capture from flue gas. Membrane cost and reliability issues will be key to the eventual competitiveness of this technology for flue gas treatment.",

    "text":"Flooding Stress: Acclimations and Genetic Diversity. Flooding is an environmental stress for many natural and man-made ecosystems worldwide. Genetic diversity in the plant response to flooding includes alterations in architecture, metabolism, and elongation growth associated with a low O 2 escape strategy and an antithetical quiescence scheme that allows endurance of prolonged submergence. Flooding is frequently accompanied with a reduction of cellular O 2 content that is particularly severe when photosynthesis is limited or absent. This necessitates the production of ATP and regeneration of NAD + through anaerobic respiration. The examination of gene regulation and function in model systems provides insight into low-O 2 -sensing mechanisms and metabolic adjustments associated with controlled use of carbohydrate and ATP. At the developmental level, plants can escape the low-O 2 stress caused by flooding through multifaceted alterations in cellular and organ structure that promote access to and diffusion of O 2 . These processes are driven by phytohormones, including ethylene, gibberellin, and abscisic acid. This exploration of natural variation in strategies that improve O 2 and carbohydrate status during flooding provides valuable resources for the improvement of crop endurance of an environmental adversity that is enhanced by global warming.",

The Automated force field Topology Builder (ATB, http:\/\/compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au\/atb ) is a Web-accessible server that can provide topologies and parameters for a wide range of molecules appropriate for use in molecular simulations, computational drug design, and X-ray refinement. The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force fields, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting configurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a specific phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force field descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force fields in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of the GROMOS force field. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.",

The limitations in the cathode capacity compared with that of the anode have been an impediment to advance the lithium-ion battery technology. The lithium\u2013sulphur system is appealing in this regard, as sulphur exhibits an order of magnitude higher capacity than the currently used cathodes. However, low active material utilization and poor cycle life hinder the practicality of lithium\u2013sulphur batteries. Here we report a simple adjustment to the traditional lithium\u2013sulphur battery configuration to achieve high capacity with a long cycle life and rapid charge rate. With a bifunctional microporous carbon paper between the cathode and separator, we observe a significant improvement not only in the active material utilization but also in capacity retention, without involving complex synthesis or surface modification. The insertion of a microporous carbon interlayer decreases the internal charge transfer resistance and localizes the soluble polysulphide species, facilitating a commercially feasible means of fabricating the lithium\u2013sulphur batteries. The practical performance of lithium sulphide batteries is much less than their predicted performance because redox products dissolve over time.

An Agricultural and Industrial Advisory Board provided guidance to the project. Pretreatment conditions were selected based on the extensive experience of the team with each of the technologies, and the resulting fluid and solid streams were characterized using standard methods. The data were used to close material balances, and energy balances were estimated for all processes. The digestibilities of the solids by a controlled supply of cellulase enzyme and the fermentability of the liquids were also assessed and used to guide selection of optimum pretreatment conditions. Economic assessments were applied based on the performance data to estimate each pretreatment cost on a consistent basis.

Modern herbicides make major contributions to global food production by easily removing weeds and substituting for destructive soil cultivation. However, persistent herbicide selection of huge weed numbers across vast areas can result in the rapid evolution of herbicide resistance. Herbicides target specific enzymes, and mutations are selected that confer resistance-endowing amino acid substitutions, decreasing herbicide binding. Where herbicides bind within an enzyme catalytic site very few mutations give resistance while conserving enzyme functionality. Where herbicides bind away from a catalytic site many resistance-endowing mutations may evolve. Increasingly, resistance evolves due to mechanisms limiting herbicide reaching target sites. Especially threatening are herbicide-degrading cytochrome P450 enzymes able to detoxify existing, new, and even herbicides yet to be discovered. Global weed species are accumulating resistance mechanisms, displaying multiple resistance across many herbicides and posing a great challenge to herbicide sustainability in world agriculture. Fascinating genetic issues associated with resistance evolution remain to be investigated, especially the possibility of herbicide stress unleashing epigenetic gene expression.

Nature's photosynthesis uses the sun's energy with chlorophyll in plants as a catalyst to recycle carbon dioxide and water into new plant life. Only given sufficient geological time can new fossil fuels be formed naturally. In contrast, chemical recycling of carbon dioxide from natural and industrial sources as well as varied human activities or even from the air itself to methanol or dimethyl ether (DME) and their varied products can be achieved via its capture and subsequent reductive hydrogenative conversion. The present Perspective reviews this new approach and our research in the field over the last 15 years. Carbon recycling represents a significant aspect of our proposed Methanol Economy. Any available energy source (alternative energies such as solar, wind, geothermal, and atomic energy) can be used for the production of needed hydrogen and chemical conversion of CO(2). Improved new methods for the efficient reductive conversion of CO(2) to methanol and\/or DME that we have developed include bireforming with methane and ways of catalytic or electrochemical conversions. Liquid methanol is preferable to highly volatile and potentially explosive hydrogen for energy storage and transportation. Together with the derived DME, they are excellent transportation fuels for internal combustion engines (ICE) and fuel cells as well as convenient starting materials for synthetic hydrocarbons and their varied products. Carbon dioxide thus can be chemically transformed from a detrimental greenhouse gas causing global warming into a valuable, renewable and inexhaustible carbon source of the future allowing environmentally neutral use of carbon fuels and derived hydrocarbon products.",

Over the past decade, upconversion has become more prominent in biological sciences as the preparation of high-quality lanthanide-doped nanoparticles has become increasingly routine. Owing to their small physical dimensions and biocompatibility, upconversion nanoparticles can be easily coupled to proteins or other biological macromolecular systems and used in a variety of assay formats ranging from bio-detection to cancer therapy. In addition, intense visible emission from these nanoparticles under near-infrared excitation, which is less harmful to biological samples and has greater sample penetration depths than conventional ultraviolet excitation, enhances their prospects as luminescent stains in bio-imaging. In this article, we review recent developments in optical biolabeling and bio-imaging involving upconversion nanoparticles, simultaneously bringing to the forefront the desirable characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of these luminescent nanomaterials.",

There are a suite of mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi can influence soil aggregation at each of these various scales. By extension of these mechanisms to the question of fungal diversity, it is recognized that different species or communities of fungi can promote soil aggregation to different degrees. We argue that soil aggregation should be included in a more complete 'multifunctional' perspective of mycorrhizal ecology, and that in-depth understanding of mycorrhizas\/soil process relationships will require analyses emphasizing feedbacks between soil structure and mycorrhizas, rather than a uni-directional approach simply addressing mycorrhizal effects on soils.

These variables reflect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate. However, the efficacy of the different indicators is affected by regional response to climate change, characteristics of the catchment, and lake mixing regimes. Thus, particular indicators or combinations of indicators are more effective for different lake types and geographic regions. The extraction of climate signals can be further complicated by the influence of other environmental changes, such as eutrophication or acidification, and the equivalent reverse phenomena, in addition to other land-use influences.

Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF\/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach.

One of the conclusions drawn at the CASP4 meeting in Asilomar was that applying various force fields during refinement of template-based models tends to move predictions in the wrong direction, away from the experimentally determined coordinates. We have derived an all-atom force field aimed at protein and nucleotide optimization in vacuo (NOVA), which has been specifically designed to avoid this problem. NOVA resembles common molecular dynamics force fields but has been automatically parameterized with two major goals: (i) not to make high resolution X-ray structures worse and (ii) to improve homology models built by WHAT IF. Force-field parameters were not required to be physically correct; instead, they were optimized with random Monte Carlo moves in force-field parameter space, each one evaluated by simulated annealing runs of a 50-protein optimization set. Errors inherent to the approximate force-field equation could thus be canceled by errors in force-field parameters. Compared with the optimization set, the force field did equally well on an independent validation set and is shown to move in silico models closer to reality. It can be applied to modeling applications as well as X-ray and NMR structure refinement. A new method to assign force-field parameters based on molecular trees is also presented.

It is very important to understand the physiological, biochemical and ecological interventions related to these stresses for better management.

This systems approach provides a highly integrated picture of the physiological modules supporting macrophage polarization, identifying potential pharmacologic control points for both macrophage phenotypes. The ability to assume different activation states in response to environmental factors is critical to the role played by murine macrophages in a broad range of responses. Resting macrophages (M0) develop pro-inflammatory microbicidal and tumoricidal properties after stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (M1 or classical activation), but they will promote adipose tissue homeostasis and wound healing and mediate anti-helminth immune responses when stimulated with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 (M2 or alternative activation). This phenotypic polarization of murine macrophages in response to their microenvironment is highly regulated at both transcriptional and metabolic levels (McGettrick and O\u2019Neill, 2013McGettrick A.F.

Metabolism of inflammation limited by AMPK and pseudo-starvation.Nature. 2013; 493: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The metabolism of M1 macrophages is characterized by increased glycolytic flux and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation compared to M0 cells (Rodr\u00edguez-Prados et al., 2010Rodr\u00edguez-Prados J.C. Trav\u00e9s P.G. Cuenca J. Rico D. Aragon\u00e9s J. Mart\u00edn-Sanz P. Cascante M. Bosc\u00e1 L. Substrate fate in activated macrophages: a comparison between innate, classic, and alternative activation.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This metabolic shift occurs in the context of an altered TCA cycle, which is needed to support the production of key M1 cellular products such as acetyl CoA (AcCoA), succinate, and nitric oxide (NO) (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J. Kelly B. Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1\u03b2 through HIF-1\u03b1.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). However, the precise metabolic flows that alter the mitochondrial activity and the corresponding compensatory mechanisms that maintain basic cellular metabolic functions in the absence of an active TCA cycling in M1 macrophages are unclear. Likewise, although it is understood that M2 activation is coupled to changes in polyamine synthesis, iron metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation (Biswas and Mantovani, 2012Biswas S.K. Mantovani A. Orchestration of metabolism by macrophages.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 432-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, Vats et al., 2006Vats D. Mukundan L. Odegaard J.I.

Oxidative metabolism and PGC-1beta attenuate macrophage-mediated inflammation.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), we currently lack a systems-level understanding of central metabolic rewiring during alternative activation. In principle, integration of top-down transcriptional and metabolic \u201comics\u201d approaches provide a strategy for non-targeted characterization of systems-level changes, but two obstacles impede realization of such a strategy. First is the lack of parallel experimental approaches to enable synchronized metabolomic and transcriptional profiling on simultaneously prepared biomass; the throughput of current experimental approaches for metabolic profiling are typically quite low and require a considerable amount of input material, making it difficult to perform parallel sample preparation for transcriptional profiling. A second challenge is the uncertainty associated with integrating the two data types in a physiologically meaningful way that can be further validated through functional testing. Here, we introduce a combined experimental and computational pipeline, concordant metabolomics integration with transcription (CoMBI-T), that overcomes these challenges and provides a non-targeted systems-level characterization of coordinated transcriptional and metabolic rewiring during the macrophage polarization process. This approach identified statistically significant modules within the metabo-transcriptional network that contribute to and define M1 versus M2 polarization, which were functionally validated via a combination of targeted media perturbations, pharmacological inhibition, and 13C-glucose and 13C- and 15N-glutamine labeling experiments. In M2-polarized macrophages, CoMBI-T reveals involvement of two new previously uncharacterized modules: a glutamine-associated module and a UDP-GlcNAc-associated module. Perturbation of either of these pathways led to impairment of M2 polarization. Furthermore, glutamine deprivation is shown to be associated with profound functional consequences in M2 macrophages, such as decreased chemokine Ccl22 production. On the other hand, in M1 macrophages, CoMBI-T identified a metabolic interruption in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle carbon flow during M1 polarization, which was validated by isotope labeling. Based on that labeling data, we propose that a variant of the aspartate-arginosuccinate shunt connects the fragmented (anapleurotic) TCA cycle metabolites with NO production during the inflammatory response. Consistent with this model, inhibition of a key enzyme in the shunt, aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), led to decreased NO production and increased oxygen consumption rates (OCR) due to mitochondrial respiration in M1 macrophages. Overall, our data and analysis provide a comprehensive view of the integrated transcriptional and central metabolic changes during murine macrophage polarization, yielding a deeper contextual understanding of established polarization markers, while simultaneously uncovering targets for pharmacological intervention and control of the polarization process. The CoMBI-T pipeline to generate and integrate mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling with RNA-seq-based transcriptional profiling data sets is shown schematically in Figure 1. To provide the raw biological material for the data acquisition, bone marrow cells were isolated from a single mouse and seeded into 96-well plates as described previously (Everts et al., 2014Everts B. Amiel E. Huang S.C. Smith A.M. Chang C.H. Lam W.Y. Redmann V. Freitas T.C. Blagih J. van der Windt G.J. et al.TLR-driven early glycolytic reprogramming via the kinases TBK1-IKK\u03b5 supports the anabolic demands of dendritic cell activation.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). At day 7, the bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 treatment for 24 hr to obtain M1- and M2-polarized cells (respectively, as confirmed by expression of major markers such as Il12b, Nos2, Arg1, etc.). Cultures destined for either of the two analyses were treated identically until cells were lysed for metabolite and RNA extractions, providing minimal divergence in cell handling and maximum degree of consistency between metabolic and transcriptional profiles. To obtain metabolic profiles, we used a non-targeted, flow-injection-analysis (FIA) mass spectrometry (MS) method (Fuhrer et al., 2011Fuhrer T. Heer D. Begemann B. Zamboni N. High-throughput, accurate mass metabolome profiling of cellular extracts by flow injection-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 7074-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), enabling broad metabolite coverage between 50 and 1,000 daltons and yielding quantitative information on approximately 10,000 MS spectral features (Fuhrer et al., 2011Fuhrer T. Heer D. Begemann B. Zamboni N. High-throughput, accurate mass metabolome profiling of cellular extracts by flow injection-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 7074-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), of which approximately 2,200 were annotated as high-confidence metabolites in these studies. For transcriptional profiling, we used 3\u2032 end focused RNA sequencing with a barcode-first strategy that allows sample pooling at the cDNA stage, improving sensitivity and consistency between samples and allowing construction of a high-throughput library from material extracted from cell lysates in a single well of a 96-well plate (Sojka et al., 2014Sojka D.K. Plougastel-Douglas B. Yang L. Pak-Wittel M.A. Artyomov M.N. Ivanova Y. Zhong C. Chase J.M. Rothman P.B. Yu J. et al.Tissue-resident natural killer (NK) cells are cell lineages distinct from thymic and conventional splenic NK cells.eLife. 2014; 3: e01659Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar) (Experimental Procedures). Overall, we analyzed five and three bio-replicates per condition for metabolic and transcriptional profiles, respectively. To date, predictive powers of integrated analysis have been tested only to a very limited degree, largely due to a lack of large-scale, parallel metabo-transcriptional datasets. Overall, analytical strategies used for integration of metabolic and transcriptional data can be broadly divided into two major classes: modifications of constraint-based models (such as flux balance analysis) (Bordbar et al., 2012Bordbar A. Mo M.L. Nakayasu E.S. Schrimpe-Rutledge A.C. Kim Y.M. Metz T.O. Jones M.B. Frank B.C. Smith R.D.

Uncovering transcriptional regulation of metabolism by using metabolic network topology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and network-based approaches (Beisser et al., 2012Beisser D. Grohme M.A. Kopka J. Frohme M. Schill R.O. Hengherr S. Dandekar T. Klau G.W. Dittrich M. M\u00fcller T. Integrated pathway modules using time-course metabolic profiles and EST data from Milnesium tardigradum.BMC Syst. Biol. 2012; 6: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2012Zhu J. Sova P. Xu Q. Dombek K.M. Xu E.Y. Vu H. Tu Z. Brem R.B. Bumgarner R.E. Schadt E.E. Stitching together multiple data dimensions reveals interacting metabolomic and transcriptomic networks that modulate cell regulation.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001301Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In order to leverage the large metabolite coverage achieved in our profiling experiments, we adopted a network-based strategy that integrates the power of both transcriptional and metabolic profiles while minimizing the drawbacks inherent to each dataset with respect to computational analysis. For instance, metabolic profiling often has a high false negative rate, being neither exhaustive nor adequately sensitive for low-abundance metabolites. Nevertheless, metabolism is described by a relatively well-defined network, capturing the interconversion of various metabolites in a framework particularly suitable for systems-scale analysis. The opposite is true for transcriptional data: RNA-seq profiling provides an exhaustive list of mature transcripts, but their corresponding regulatory networks are defined very loosely, limiting the ability to follow causal relationships. Our integration strategy seeks to identify functional modules characteristic to the M1 and M2 states based on proximity of differentially regulated metabolites and enzymes in the global metabolic network. Such core subnetworks typically consist of combinations of metabolites and enzymes from multiple canonical metabolic pathways (see examples below) and provide relatively unbiased characterization of metabolic changes in the system of interest. As such, this approach differs from the typical knowledge-based pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) because it allows the capture of major routes of metabolic rewiring that occur on a global level but that do not necessarily follow known definitions of pathways. For instance, pathway analysis of obtained metabolic and transcriptional profiles (Figure 2A) revealed a combination of known pathways regulating macrophage polarization without specific understanding of functional interconnections between them. Genes involved in glycolysis and phospholipid metabolism, differentially expressed between M1 (LPS + IFN-\u03b3 stimulation) and M2 (IL-4 stimulation) macrophages, are major distinguishing features of inflammatory (M1) macrophages, whereas oxidative phosphorylation, purine synthesis, arginine, and nucleotide sugar metabolism are enhanced in M2 macrophages. Global metabolic changes showed differential regulation of glycolysis\/gluconeogenesis, urea cycle, arginine, mitochondrial, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure 2B). However, the interpretative utility of these findings is severely limited because the interconnections between these pathways are not revealed even though macrophage polarization requires them to be globally coordinated. Furthermore, pathway-based analysis fails to account for many of the most differentially expressed metabolites: in M1 macrophages itaconic acid (Figure 2C, green circle) is currently not annotated to be the part of any individual pathway, and a number of the most altered M2 metabolites such as UDP-glucose and 6-phosphogluconate (Figure 2C, red circles) are not associated with any of the enriched pathways. Finally, pathway analyses that are carried out on the individual levels of regulation (whether transcriptional or metabolic) inherently fail to leverage the notion of coherent changes between these regulatory events, diminishing their power to identify important regulators of metabolic rewiring. In order to address these issues, we constructed a global murine cellular reaction network (CRN) that connects \u223c3,000 metabolites and corresponding enzymes based on the latest edition of the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2012Kanehisa M. Goto S. Sato Y. Furumichi M. Tanabe M. KEGG for integration and interpretation of large-scale molecular data sets.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D109-D114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). We then sought the most differentially regulated subnetwork (typically of the size \u223c100 nodes) within the CRN, accounting for both the nodal connectivity and the degree of differential expression of metabolites and enzymes in the network. We first assign weights to nodes in the global cellular reaction network: differential expression p values for M1 versus M2 comparison were transformed to enzymatic node weights, and differential intensity p values of metabolites corresponded to metabolic node weights. By structuring the CRN in this manner, we were able to apply the BioNet algorithm (Beisser et al., 2010Beisser D. Klau G.W. Dandekar T. M\u00fcller T. Dittrich M.T. BioNet: an R-Package for the functional analysis of biological networks.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 1129-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), developed for integration of protein-protein interaction databases with microarray datasets, to identify the most differentially regulated network as a maximum-weight connected subgraph (MWCS) problem (Figure 3; Experimental Procedures). Overall, CoMBI-T analysis indicated that divergent macrophage polarization is characterized by significant differences in three metabo-transcriptional modules (the UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis module, a glutamine\/glutamate-associated module in M2 macrophages, and an Idh-centered TCA pathway break-point coupled with dramatic itaconate production in M1-polarized macrophages) that together with known regulatory pathways make up a densely connected core that governs macrophage metabolic response to polarization stimuli (Figure 3). Next, we sought to investigate the function of these modules in greater detail. CoMBI-T identified two previously unreported M2-specific metabolic modules. First, increased amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, characterized by high levels of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucose, and UDP-glucuronate, and corresponding transcriptional upregulation of enzymes involved in the production of these intermediates (e.g., Enpp1, Pgm1), were observed in M2 macrophages (Figure 3). To validate that this module is indeed metabolically active in M2-polarized macrophages, we traced the fate of 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine in M2 cells to the intermediates of these pathways. Labeling distribution analyses revealed partially labeled forms of TCA metabolites (malate, citrate, AKG, succinate) in M0 and M2 macrophages (Figure 4A), reflecting reported active oxygen consumption rates and complete TCA cycling in M2 macrophages (Haschemi et al., 2012Haschemi A. Kosma P. Gille L. Evans C.R. Burant C.F. Starkl P. Knapp B. Haas R. Schmid J.A. Jandl C. et al.The sedoheptulose kinase CARKL directs macrophage polarization through control of glucose metabolism.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 813-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Consistent with the known hexosamine biosynthetic route, we found glucose and glutamine as the major sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively, in UDP-GlcNAc, an important intermediate that links signaling to metabolism (Figure 4A; Wellen and Thompson, 2012Wellen K.E. Thompson C.B. A two-way street: reciprocal regulation of metabolism and signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 270-276PubMed Google Scholar, Yi et al., 2012Yi W. Clark P.M. Mason D.E. Keenan M.C. Hill C. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Peters E.C. Driggers E.M. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Phosphofructokinase 1 glycosylation regulates cell growth and metabolism.Science. 2012; 337: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Together with transcriptional upregulation of steps in the N-glycan pathway revealed through pathway enrichment analysis (see Figure 2A), this observation suggests the importance of N-glycosylation in M2 macrophages. It is well established that highly glycosylated lectin\/mannose receptors are among the most typical M2 polarization markers (Sica and Mantovani, 2012Sica A. Mantovani A. Macrophage plasticity and polarization: in vivo veritas.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar). We investigated the functional importance of the UDP-GlcNAc pathway by asking directly whether N-glycosylation plays a role in M2 activation. Accordingly, we stimulated macrophages with IL-4 in the presence or absence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Varki, 2009Varki A. Essentials of Glycobiology.Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2009Google Scholar). We found that tunicamycin significantly inhibited expression of the canonical M2 activation markers Relm\u03b1 (Figure 4B), CD206, and CD301 (Figure 4C), only mildly affecting M1 polarization as measured by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression (Figure S1A) or regulation of major M1-specific cytokines (Figure S1B). Similarly, M2-specific defects were observed when we inhibited the hexosamine pathway via glucosamine (Figure S1C; Koch et al., 1979Koch H.U. Schwarz R.T. Scholtissek C. Glucosamine itself mediates reversible inhibition of protein glycosylation. A study of glucosamine metabolism at inhibitory concentrations in influenza-virus-infected cells.Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis pathway identified by CoMBI-T as being upregulated in M2 macrophages plays a direct, specific, and critical role in the M2 polarization process. The second M2-specific module revealed by CoMBI-T was centered on glutamate management and included glutamate, AKG, ornithine, and corresponding transcripts of Gatm, Arg1, Oat, Got2, and Gpt2 as well as several other closely related transcripts and metabolites (Figure 3). This result together with the participation of glutamine in supporting an active TCA cycle and providing structural features for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis led us to hypothesize that this amino acid plays a crucial, specific role in M2 polarization. The extent of glutamine dependence in M2 macrophages was suggested by the fact that a third of all carbons in TCA metabolites in M2 cells originated from glutamine (versus \u223c20% for M1) and that within 4 hr of addition of 15N-labeled glutamine, more than half of the nitrogen in UDP-GlcNAc derived from glutamine (Figure 4A). To functionally validate these findings from CoMBI-T, we transiently (for 4 hr prior to stimulation) deprived macrophages of glutamine and assessed M2 commitment, using expression of CD206, CD301, and Relm\u03b1 as markers of M2 activation. We found that glutamine deprivation had a substantial effect on M2 polarization, reducing the committed population by about 50% (Figure 5A), whereas removal of glutamine had no effect on capacity for M1 polarization as measured by Nos2 upregulation (Figure 5B). We next sought to determine specific functional defects in M2-polarized macrophages due to glutamine deprivation. We obtained transcriptional profiles for macrophages polarized in either complete media or in glutamine-deprived media and found that most of the differentially expressed transcripts that are downregulated upon glutamine withdrawal are M2-specific marker genes, including Irf4, Klf4, Ccl22, and Il4i1. Notably, glutamine-deprived M2 macrophages exhibited a distinctly downregulated transcriptional signature of TCA cycle activity (Figure 5C) when compared to M2 macrophages polarized in full media, thus providing support for a causal link between glutamine usage, regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, and M2 polarization, as opposed to other possibilities such as an effect via the mTOR pathway (Byles et al., 2013Byles V. Covarrubias A.J. Ben-Sahra I. Lamming D.W. Sabatini D.M. Manning B.D. Horng T. The TSC-mTOR pathway regulates macrophage polarization.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), which was not regulated upon glutamine deprivation (Figures S2A\u2013S2C). This is consistent with literature reporting that transient glutamine deprivation in a human cell line led to perturbation of TCA cycle and autophagy as opposed to the activation of mTOR signaling typically seen in more severe starvation conditions (Shanware et al., 2014Shanware N.P. Bray K. Eng C.H. Wang F. Follettie M. Myers J. Fantin V.R. Abraham R.T. Glutamine deprivation stimulates mTOR-JNK-dependent chemokine secretion.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the chemokine pathway (Figure S2B) was found to be among those most downregulated upon glutamine deprivation, and therefore we tested the effect of glutamine depletion on production of CCL22, because expression of the encoding gene Ccl22 is markedly upregulated in M2 macrophages and it is the second most-downregulated transcript upon glutamine deprivation (p = 10\u221257; Figure 5D, in red are shown transcripts that are M2-specific up- or downregulated markers). Accordingly, secreted protein levels of CCL22 was lower in supernatants of M2 macrophages activated in the absence of glutamine compared to in complete medium, reflecting a marked and M2-specific downstream functional defect due to media perturbation (Figure 5E). The CCR2 transcript was expressed in only low amounts basally, and hence differential transcript expression did not translate to differences in surface protein expression (Figure S2D). One of the major metabolic signatures of macrophage activation upon LPS stimulation is a defect in overall mitochondrial function (Biswas and Mantovani, 2012Biswas S.K. Mantovani A. Orchestration of metabolism by macrophages.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 432-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and associated defects in the TCA cycle. However, the specific mechanism leading to such mitochondrial dysfunction is not understood. CoMBI-T analysis revealed a potential breakpoint in the metabolic flow of the TCA cycle at the isocitrate-to-oxoglutarate (AKG) conversion, which was specific to M1 versus M2 macrophages (Figure 3, green square). This effect was characterized by a significantly increased pool of (iso)citrate and decreased pool of AKG (the ratio of (iso)citrate:AKG is \u223c3 times higher in M1 compared to M0; Table S2) and was accompanied by significant transcriptional downregulation of Idh1, the enzyme that interconverts these two metabolites (7-fold decrease in M1). To further validate that this alteration of citrate and AKG steady-state levels results from reduced flow through IDH, we performed stable isotopic labeling experiments, tracing the fate of 13C-labels from U-13C-glucose and U-13C-glutamine in M1 macrophages with a single time point analysis to estimate relative rates of accumulation (4 hr labeling time). Consistent with CoMBI-T results, we observed that \u223c20% of citrate was synthesized from glucose, whereas the AKG pool accumulated 0% glucose-derived carbon labeling at the 4 hr time point (Figure 6). Carbon flow from glutamine to AKG was detectable in M1 macrophages (Figure 6: 10%\u201312% U-13C-AKG from U-13C-glutamine after 4 hr labeling), yet still significantly smaller than in the M0 state, where \u223c25% of the AKG pool acquired uniform labeling. Of note, partially labeled forms in the AKG pool present in M0 state reflective of active TCA cycling disappeared from the AKG pool in M1 macrophages (Figure 6, pie charts in black and green ovals next to AKG). Such a lack of partial labeling indicates interrupted TCA cycle activity and provides a mechanistic explanation for the reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in M1 state. Notably, reverse flow at Idh is also undetectably low based on the absence of 5 carbon label from glutamine feed in citrate (from 5-labeled AKG). It is important to point out that in the context of greatly reduced Idh activity and associated reduction of carbon flow to AKG, citric acid is redirected to serve as a precursor for itaconic acid synthesis, an important anti-microbial metabolite identified recently (Michelucci et al., 2013Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A. et al.Immune-responsive gene 1 protein links metabolism to immunity by catalyzing itaconic acid production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Our U-13C-glucose and U-13C-glutamine labeling studies here are consistent with citrate serving as the direct chemical source for itaconic acid (Figure 6). Further supporting this possibility, we found Irg1, which encodes the enzyme catalyzing the aconitate-to-itaconate reaction (Michelucci et al., 2013Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A. et al.Immune-responsive gene 1 protein links metabolism to immunity by catalyzing itaconic acid production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), to be one of the most upregulated transcripts in M1 relative to M0 macrophages (Figure 3). The U-13C-glutamine tracing experiments suggested an additional breakpoint in the TCA for M1 ma",

In light of possible concerns over rising lithium costs in the future, Na and Na-ion batteries have re-emerged as candidates for medium and large-scale stationary energy storage, especially as a result of heightened interest in renewable energy sources that provide intermittent power which needs to be load-levelled.

These range from high-temperature air electrodes to new layered oxides, polyanion-based materials, carbons and other insertion materials for sodium-ion batteries, many of which hold promise for future sodium-based energy storage applications. In this article, the challenges of current high-temperature sodium technologies including Na-S and Na-NiCl2 and new molten sodium technology, Na-O2 are summarized.

    "text":"A review of the primary measures for tar elimination in biomass gasification processes. Tar formation is one of the major problems to deal with during biomass gasification. Tar condenses at reduced temperature, thus blocking and fouling process equipments such as engines and turbines. Considerable efforts have been directed on tar removal from fuel gas. Tar removal technologies can broadly be divided into two approaches; hot gas cleaning after the gasifier (secondary methods), and treatments inside the gasifier (primary methods). Although secondary methods are proven to be effective, treatments inside the gasifier are gaining much attention as these may eliminate the need for downstream cleanup. In primary treatment, the gasifier is optimized to produce a fuel gas with minimum tar concentration. The different approaches of primary treatment are (a) proper selection of operating parameters, (b) use of bed additive\/catalyst, and (c) gasifier modifications. The operating parameters such as temperature, gasifying agent, equivalence ratio, residence time, etc. play an important role in formation and decomposition of tar. There is a potential of using some active bed additives such as dolomite, olivine, char, etc. inside the gasifier. Ni-based catalyst are reported to be very effective not only for tar reduction, but also for decreasing the amount of nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia. Also, reactor modification can improve the quality of the product gas. The concepts of two-stage gasification and secondary air injection in the gasifier are of prime importance. Some aspects of primary methods and the research and development in this area are reviewed and cited in the present paper.",

    "text":"The Nucleosynthetic Signature of Population III. Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive (~100-300 M\u2609). Could these stars have left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range MHe = 64-133 M\u2609, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of approximately 140-260 M\u2609. Above MHe = 133 M\u2609, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter helium core masses, ~40-63 M\u2609, violent pulsations occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140 M\u2609 (MHe = 9-63 M\u2609) as well as those above 260 M\u2609. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 M\u2609 of 56Ni is produced, making these the most energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge (Si, S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear charge\u2014Na, Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack of s- and r-processes. The Fe\/Si ratio is quite sensitive to whether the upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 M\u2609 or somewhere between 140 and 260 M\u2609. When the yields of pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of the nucleosynthesis of Population III stars from 12 to 40 M\u2609, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of odd-Z elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our predictions are discussed.",

Recently developed strategies for isolating single-layer carbon sheets from graphite have enabled production of electrically conductive, mechanically robust polymer nanocomposites with enhanced gas barrier performance at extremely low loading. In this article, we present processing, morphology, and properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) reinforced with exfoliated graphite. For the first time, we compare carbon sheets exfoliated from graphite oxide (GO) via two different processes: chemical modification (isocyanate treated GO, iGO) and thermal exfoliation (thermally reduced GO, TRG), and three different methods of dispersion: solvent blending, in situ polymerization, and melt compounding. Incorporation of as low as 0.5 wt % of TRG produced electrically conductive TPU. Up to a 10-fold increase in tensile stiffness and 90% decrease in nitrogen permeation of TPU were observed with only 3 wt % iGO, implying a high aspect ratio of exfoliated platelets. Real- and reciprocal-space morphological characterization indicated that solvent-based blending techniques more effectively distribute thin exfoliated sheets in the polymer matrix than melt processing. This observation is in good qualitative agreement with the dispersion level inferred from solid property enhancements. Although also processed in solvents, property increase via in situ polymerization was not as pronounced because of reduced hydrogen bonding in the TPU produced.",

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BO) has proven effective for the accurate determination of chemical reactions, molecular dynamics and phonon frequencies in a wide range of metallic systems. Graphene, recently discovered in the free state, is a zero band-gap semiconductor, which becomes a metal if the Fermi energy is tuned applying a gate-voltage Vg. Graphene electrons near the Fermi energy have twodimensional massless dispersions, described by Dirac cones. Here we show that a change in Vg induces a stiffening of the Raman G peak (i.e. the zone-center E2g optical phonon), which cannot be described within BO. Indeed, the E2g vibrations cause rigid oscillations of the Dirac-cones in the reciprocal space. If the electrons followed adiabatically the Dirac-cone oscillations, no change in the phonon frequency would be observed. Instead, since the electron-momentum relaxation near the Fermi level is much slower than the phonon motion, the electrons do not follow the Dirac-cone displacements. This invalidates BO and results in the observed phonon stiffening. This spectacular failure of BO is quite significant since BO has been the fundamental paradigm to determine crystal vibrations from the early days of quantum mechanics.",

Terrestrial ecosystems are receiving elevated inputs of nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources and understanding how these increases in N availability affect soil microbial communities is critical for predicting the associated effects on belowground ecosystems. We used a suite of approaches to analyze the structure and functional characteristics of soil microbial communities from replicated plots in two long-term N fertilization experiments located in contrasting systems. Pyrosequencing-based analyses of 16S rRNA genes revealed no significant effects of N fertilization on bacterial diversity, but significant effects on community composition at both sites; copiotrophic taxa (including members of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla) typically increased in relative abundance in the high N plots, with oligotrophic taxa (mainly Acidobacteria) exhibiting the opposite pattern. Consistent with the phylogenetic shifts under N fertilization, shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed increases in the relative abundances of genes associated with DNA\/RNA replication, electron transport and protein metabolism, increases that could be resolved even with the shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing conducted here (average of 75 000 reads per sample). We also observed shifts in the catabolic capabilities of the communities across the N gradients that were significantly correlated with the phylogenetic and metagenomic responses, indicating possible linkages between the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest that N fertilization may, directly or indirectly, induce a shift in the predominant microbial life-history strategies, favoring a more active, copiotrophic microbial community, a pattern that parallels the often observed replacement of K-selected with r-selected plant species with elevated N.",

Oncogenic Ras has previously been shown to promote macropinocytosis; here it is demonstrated that this process allows tumour cells to use extracellular proteins to generate amino acids necessary to support tumour growth. This paper describes a previously unrecognized pathway of nutrient supply to cancer cells. Oncogenic Ras proteins are known to promote macropinocytosis, an endocytic process by which extracellular fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through vesicles known as macropinosomes. Dafna Bar-Sagi and colleagues now demonstrate that Ras-transformed cells can use this process to 'feed' on extracellular protein. The macropinocytosed protein undergoes degradation, giving rise to free amino acids necessary to support tumour growth. This finding suggests that inhibition of macropinocytosis may be effective against a subset of cancers. Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved endocytic process by which extracellular fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through large, heterogeneous vesicles known as macropinosomes. Oncogenic Ras proteins have been shown to stimulate macropinocytosis but the functional contribution of this uptake mechanism to the transformed phenotype remains unknown1,2,3. Here we show that Ras-transformed cells use macropinocytosis to transport extracellular protein into the cell. The internalized protein undergoes proteolytic degradation, yielding amino acids including glutamine that can enter central carbon metabolism. Accordingly, the dependence of Ras-transformed cells on free extracellular glutamine for growth can be suppressed by the macropinocytic uptake of protein. Consistent with macropinocytosis representing an important route of nutrient uptake in tumours, its pharmacological inhibition compromises the growth of Ras-transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts. These results identify macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which cancer cells support their unique metabolic needs and point to the possible exploitation of this process in the design of anticancer therapies.",

The helical peptide is located in a hydrophobic channel that passes through the center of the ellipsoid at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with its long axis. The complex is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions which, from the CaM side, involve an unusually large number of methionines. Key residues of the peptide are Trp4 and Phe17, which serve to anchor the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the peptide to the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of CaM, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that a number of peptides that bind CaM with high affinity share this common feature containing either aromatic residues or long-chain hydrophobic ones separated by a stretch of 12 residues, suggesting that they interact with CaM in a similar manner.",

    "text":"Analysis of optimality in natural and perturbed metabolic networks. An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.",

Although the delivery of ecosystem services is strongly affected by abiotic drivers and direct land use effects, it is also modulated by the functional diversity of biological communities (the value, range, and relative abundance of functional traits in a given ecosystem). The focus of this article is on integrating the different possible mechanisms by which functional diversity affects ecosystem properties that are directly relevant to ecosystem services. We propose a systematic way for progressing in understanding how land cover change affects these ecosystem properties through functional diversity modifications. Models on links between ecosystem properties and the local mean, range, and distribution of plant trait values are numerous, but they have been scattered in the literature, with varying degrees of empirical support and varying functional diversity components analyzed. Here we articulate these different components in a single conceptual and methodological framework that allows testing them in combination. We illustrate our approach with examples from the literature and apply the proposed framework to a grassland system in the central French Alps in which functional diversity, by responding to land use change, alters the provision of ecosystem services important to local stakeholders. We claim that our framework contributes to opening a new area of research at the interface of land change science and fundamental ecology.",

H(2)-air polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells are electrochemical power generators with potential vehicle propulsion applications.

Fe-based cathode catalysts are promising contenders, but their power density has been low compared with Pt-based cathodes, largely due to poor mass-transport properties. Here we report an iron-acetate\/phenanthroline\/zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-derived electrocatalyst with increased volumetric activity and enhanced mass-transport properties. The zeolitic-imidazolate-framework serves as a microporous host for phenanthroline and ferrous acetate to form a catalyst precursor that is subsequently heat treated. A cathode made with the best electrocatalyst from this work, tested in H(2)-O(2,) has a power density of 0.75 W cm(-2) at 0.6 V, a meaningful voltage for polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells operation, comparable with that of a commercial Pt-based cathode tested under identical conditions.",

The 16-day revisit cycle of Landsat has long limited its use for studying global biophysical processes, which evolve rapidly during the growing season. In cloudy areas of the Earth, the problem is compounded, and researchers are fortunate to get two to three clear images per year. At the same time, the coarse resolution of sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) limits the sensors' ability to quantify biophysical processes in heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, the authors present a new spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm to blend Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Using this approach, high-frequency temporal information from MODIS and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat can be blended for applications that require high resolution in both time and space. The MODIS daily 500-m surface reflectance and the 16-day repeat cycle Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30-m surface reflectance are used to produce a synthetic \"daily\" surface reflectance product at ETM+ spatial resolution. The authors present results both with simulated (model) data and actual Landsat\/MODIS acquisitions. In general, the STARFM accurately predicts surface reflectance at an effective resolution close to that of the ETM+. However, the performance depends on the characteristic patch size of the landscape and degrades somewhat when used on extremely heterogeneous fine-grained landscapes",

The increase in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from over a century of combustion of fossil fuels has been associated with significant global climate change. With the global population increase driving continued increases in fossil fuel use, humanity's primary reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or \"direct air capture\" (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. The past decade has seen a steep rise in the use of chemical sorbents that are cycled through sorption and desorption cycles for CO2 removal from ultradilute gases such as air. This Review provides a historical overview of the field of DAC, along with an exhaustive description of the use of chemical sorbents targeted at this application. Solvents and solid sorbents that interact strongly with CO2 are described, including basic solvents, supported amine and ammonium materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the primary classes of chemical sorbents. Hypothetical processes for the deployment of such sorbents are discussed, as well as the limited array of technoeconomic analyses published on DAC. Overall, it is concluded that there are many new materials that could play a role in emerging DAC technologies.

A set of standardized TMAs was produced to allow for rapid screening of a multitude of different tissues and cell types using immunohistochemistry.

Altogether more than 700 proteins were analyzed representing all major types of protein families, i.e. protein receptors, kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors, and nuclear receptors. The results are presented as a publicly available protein atlas database, and the data suggest that it should be possible to extend this analysis to most or all human proteins. This approach could also quite effectively be used for generation of expression data for model animals such as mouse, rat, and chimpanzee. A valuable tool for medical and biological research can thus be envisioned as a complement to genome and transcript profiling data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Antigens\u2014Suitable protein epitope signature tags (PrESTs), representing unique regions for each target protein, were designed using bioinformatic tools (12Lindskog M.

In the design of the PrESTs, transmembrane regions and signal peptides were avoided, and an amino acid sequence with a size between 100 and 150 amino acids and low homology to other human proteins was selected to decrease the risk of cross-reactivity of antibodies to other human proteins. The cloning, protein expression, immunization, and affinity purification to yield monospecific antibodies were performed as described previously by Agaton et al. (8Agaton C. Galli J.

The PrESTs were subsequently spotted and immobilized onto epoxide slides (Corning Life Sciences) using a pin-and-ring arrayer (Affymetrix 427). The slides were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS (5 min), and then the surface was blocked with SuperBlock (Pierce) for 30 min. An adhesive 16-well silicone mask (Schleicher & Schuell) was applied to the glass before addition of the msAb diluted 1:2000 in 1\u00d7 PBST (1\u00d7 PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of approximately 50 ng\/ml. Hen-generated tag-specific antibodies recovered from the depletion step were co-incubated with the monospecific antibodies, and the glass slides were incubated on a shaker for 60 min. The slides were washed with 1\u00d7 PBST and 1\u00d7 PBS two times for 10 min each before the secondary antibodies goat-anti rabbit Alexa 647 and goat anti-chicken Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:60,000 to 30 ng\/ml in 1\u00d7 PBST were added and incubated for 60 min. After the same washing procedure as for the first incubation, the slides were spun dry and scanned using a G2565BA array scanner (Agilent), and images were quantified using the image analysis software GenePix 5.1 (Axon Instruments).Western Blots\u2014Western blot analysis of affinity-purified antibodies was performed by separation of total protein extracts from selected human cell lines and tissues on precast 10\u201320% Criterion\u2122 SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions followed by electrotransfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The membranes were blocked (5% dry milk, 0.5% Tween 20, 1\u00d7 TBS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with the primary antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer, and washed in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with Tween 20. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin\/horseradish peroxidase, Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) was diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer, and chemiluminescence detection was carried out using a Chemidoc charge-couple device camera (Bio-Rad) and SuperSignal\u00ae West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Immunohistochemistry\u2014Slides were baked for 45 min in 60 \u00b0C, deparaffinized in xylene, hydrated in graded alcohols, and blocked for endogenous peroxidase in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide diluted in 80% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, a Decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) was used. Slides were immersed and boiled in Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.0 (Dakocytomation) for 4 min at 125 \u00b0C and then allowed to cool down to 90 \u00b0C. Automated immunohistochemistry was done using an Autostainer Plus instrument (Dakocytomation). Primary antibodies and a dextran polymer visualization system (Envision, Dakocytomation) were incubated for 30 min each at room temperature, and slides were developed for 2 \u00d7 5 min using diaminobenzidine (Dakocytomation) as chromogen. Each incubation was followed by rinsing in wash buffer (Dakocytomation). After a short rinse in tap water, slides were counterstained in Harris hematoxylin (Sigma) and coverslipped using Pertex (Histolab, Gothenburg, Sweden) as mounting medium.Digital Imaging of the Tissue Cores\u2014All immunohistochemically stained sections from the eight different TMAs were scanned using an automated slide-scanning system, ScanScope T2 (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). For each antibody 576 digital images were generated to represent the total content of the eight TMAs. Scanning was performed at 20\u00d7 magnification. Digital images were separated and extracted as individual TIFF files for storage of original data. The size of each TIFF image is \u223c20\u201330 megabytes. The high resolution TIFF images are stored on digital tapes, and to facilitate handling the images in a web-based annotation system the individual, images were compressed from TIFF format into JPEG format.Scoring of Protein Expression\u2014The annotation software was developed to allow for a basic and rapid evaluation of immunoreactivity in a broad spectrum of different tissues and cell types. The annotation tool software was developed to run on any standard desktop personal computer (Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems) using an ordinary web browser interface. Parameters that were annotated included overall staining, congruity in staining between triplicate\/duplicate samples, validation of immunohistochemical staining as well as staining intensity, fraction of immunoreactive cells, and pattern and localization of immunoreactivity (nuclear, cytoplasmic, or cell membranous). A text box was also included for comments.Information Technology\u2014The protein atlas is a web-based service clustered on multiple web servers, each serving the web pages, database, and all the images individually due to \u201cfail-safe\u201d demands. All software used within the protein atlas are open source based on the LAMP setup (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The protein atlas is loaded with data and image files from the HPR-LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System), which is the production system especially developed for and used within the HPR project.RESULTSThe Monospecific Antibodies Used in the Protein Atlas\u2014In this study, we generated monospecific antibodies by a strategy where PrESTs are used both as antigens for the development of polyclonal antibodies and as affinity ligands for the subsequent affinity purification of the antibodies as described before (8Agaton C.

Rockberg J. Uhlen M. Sterky F. Selection of protein epitopes for antibody production.BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 723-727Google Scholar). In addition, we used commercially available antibodies selected primarily by their medical relevance and importance. Altogether 718 antibodies representing all human chromosomes were used to create the protein atlas, although the focus was on chromosomes 14, 22, and X for the monospecific antibodies (Fig. 1).Validation of the Antibodies\u2014The monospecific antibodies were validated using a broad range of quality assurance analyses. All cloned gene fragments were sequence-verified, and the recombinant produced antigens (PrESTs) were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry to verify the expected molecular weight (data not shown). The affinity-purified antibodies were analyzed by a novel protein array method (9Nilsson P. Paavilainen L. Larsson K. \u00d6dling J. Sundberg M. Andersson A.-C. Kampf C. Persson A. Szigyarto C. A.-K.

Towards a human proteome atlas: high-throughput generation of mono-specific antibodies for tissue profiling.Proteomics. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar) in which a multitude of human protein fragments (PrESTs) were spotted on a single glass slide. This assay, using fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for signal detection, provides information about the specificity and purity of the monospecific antibodies. In Fig. 2, four examples of this analysis are shown in which 1440 PrEST fragments have been spotted in triplicates on glass slides, and the signal of the antibody binding to each spot is shown. Furthermore the figure shows two separate examples of the results from the protein array analysis for duplicate antibody fractions obtained by immunizing two separate animals with the same antigen (Fig. 2, a\/b and c\/d, respectively). The results show that the antibodies are in each case specific for the antigen and also that reproducible antibodies, as judged by the protein array, can be obtained by immunization with the same antigen in two separate animals.Fig. 2Protein microarrays for validation of antibodies. The results of the specificity analysis of two pairs of monospecific antibodies on protein arrays with 1440 PrESTs are shown. Each pair (a and b and c and d) corresponds to antibodies generated against the same antigen in two different animals. The red bar corresponds to the relative signal from the specific antigen, and the black bars represent the cross-reactivity to the other PrESTs. In each graph is an image from one-fourth of the array inserted. A dual color system is used where the presence of all proteins is detected in green, and the specific antibody is detected in red. a and b, antibodies HPR000534 and HPR001102 directed against a DnaJ homolog protein. c and d, antibodies HPR000830 and HPR001088 directed against a predicted KIAA protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In most cases, the monospecific antibodies were further validated by Western blotting with total protein extracts from selected human cell lines and tissues. These analyses give important data about protein size and expression patterns. The standard design of the Western blots contains three human cell lines (RT-4, EFO-21, and A-431) and two human tissues (liver and tonsil). In many cases, the analysis showed a specific staining with a single band corresponding to the size of the expected human protein as exemplified by four antibodies toward four different proteins with an expected molecular mass of 61, 22, 126, and 57 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3, a\u2013d). For other antibodies additional bands were detected (Fig. 3e), and in some cases no band of the correct size could be seen (Fig. 3f). It should be noted that the lack of the expected protein or the presence of additional bands could be explained by the expression pattern for the investigated protein or by protein modifications, proteolysis, or the presence of unknown splice variants.Fig. 3Tissue Western analysis of purified monospecific antibodies. Total protein Western blots of a number of antibodies using protein extracts from human cell lines (RT-4, EFO-21, and A-431) and tissues (liver and tonsil) are shown. The filled arrow indicates the size of the expected protein as determined from the genome sequence. a, antibody HPR000427 generated toward the 61-kDa cleavage stimulation factor subunit encoded by the CSTF2 gene located on the X chromosome. b, antibody HPR000722 raised against the 22-kDa BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) transcribed from chromosome 22. c, HPR001122 recognizing the 126-kDa WD repeat and high mobility group box DNA-binding protein 1 encoded by the WDHD1gene on chromosome 14. d, HPR000527 binding to an unknown 57-kDa protein. e, HPR000798 generated toward the heat shock-related 70-kDa protein 2 gene HSPA2 located on chromosome 14. f, HPR00129 designed toward the snRNA-activating protein complex 43-kDa subunit. MWM, molecular weight marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)All antibodies were further used to stain a tissue microarray with human tissues and organs. If possible, the immunohistochemistry pattern was compared with bioinformatic data based on gene, transcript profiling, protein expression, and localization data. In addition, for selected antibodies, a competition-based adsorption assay was carried out as described previously (9Nilsson P. Paavilainen L. Larsson K. \u00d6dling J. Sundberg M. Andersson A.-C. Kampf C. Persson A. Szigyarto C. A.-K. Ottosson J. Bj\u00f6rling E. Hober S. Wern\u00e9rus H. Wester K. Pont\u00e9n F. Uhlen M. Towards a human proteome atlas: high-throughput generation of mono-specific antibodies for tissue profiling.Proteomics. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The assay was performed by incubation of the antibody with its antigen before immunostaining. Disappearance of the specific staining was interpreted as evidence that the observed immunohistochemistry pattern was specific and that the msAb recognized the expected target.Evaluation of the complete set of validation assays showed that approximately half of the antibodies exhibited possible cross-reactivity and were consequently excluded from the protein atlas database. A validation score was given for each of the remaining monospecific antibodies. A high validation score indicates that the quality assurance supports, with high confidence, the specificity of the msAb toward the expected human target protein. A low validation score shows that the antibody is probably specific to the expected target, but in this case, the validation is less clear, and cross-reactivity cannot be excluded. For the 275 msAbs analyzed in this study, 160 have a low validation score, whereas 68 and 47 have a medium or high validation score, respectively. For the 443 commercial antibodies, the only validation performed as part of the project was a comparison between our data and the data obtained from the antibody provider and a bioinformatic comparison between our experimental data from the tissue microarrays with expected tissue profiles as judged from the literature.Immunohistochemistry and Image Analysis\u2014Once the high throughput antibody-based tissue profiling was available, it became feasible to create an atlas of protein expression patterns in a multitude of normal human tissues and cancer tissues representing the 20 most prevalent cancer types. A set of standardized TMAs was produced as described by Kampf et al. (10Kampf C. Andersson A.C. Wester K. Bjorling E. Uhlen M. Ponten F. Antibody-based tissue profiling as a tool for clinical proteomics.Clin. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 285-299Google Scholar) containing 48 different human tissues in triplicate and cancer tissues from 216 individually different tumors in duplicate. Digital images for annotation of expression profiles were generated using a semiautomated approach (10Kampf C. Andersson A.C. Wester K. Bjorling E. Uhlen M. Ponten F. Antibody-based tissue profiling as a tool for clinical proteomics.Clin. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 285-299Google Scholar, 13Vrolijk H. Sloos W. Mesker W. Franken P. Fodde R. Morreau H. Tanke H. Automated acquisition of stained tissue micro arrays for high-throughput evaluation of molecular targets.J. Mol. Diagn. 2003; 5: 160-167Google Scholar), and 576 images corresponding to a total of 20 gigabytes of data were collected for each antibody. The original TIFF images were stored on digital tapes for future analysis, and the images were converted to JPEG images suitable for web-based browsing. Each JPEG image corresponds to \u223c1 megabyte of data with the image compression ratio adequate for analysis down to subcellular levels.The images were annotated by certified pathologists using a newly designed web-based annotation software. 2E. Bj\u00f6rling and P. Oksvold, unpublished data. The manual annotation of each image provides a knowledge base for functional studies and allows queries about protein profiles in normal and disease tissues. Parameters that were annotated included overall staining, congruity in staining between triplicate\/duplicate samples, and validation of immunohistochemistry staining. Staining intensity, fraction of immunoactive cells, and patterns and localization of immunoreactivity, such as nuclear, cytoplasm, or membranous, were also noted (10Kampf C. Andersson A.C. Wester K. Bjorling E. Uhlen M. Ponten F. Antibody-based tissue profiling as a tool for clinical proteomics.Clin. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 285-299Google Scholar).The initial annotation was performed during a 2-day \u201cannotation jamboree\u201d in which 26 pathologists from Sweden, Norway, and Finland gathered and annotated \u223c80,000 images using individual desktop terminals. Some antibodies were annotated independently by two or more pathologists. This allowed analysis of consistency and comparability of annotations from different pathologists. The workshop was subsequently followed by an internet-based system in which each pathologist could book a particular antibody, download the corresponding 576 images, perform the annotation, and then submit back the annotation to the central database. In this way, all the 400,000 images in the protein atlas were annotated.Protein Atlas for Normal Tissues\u2014The publicly available database (www.proteinatlas.org) contains, in the first version, more than 400,000 high resolution images corresponding to more than 700 antibodies toward human proteins. The protein profiles in normal tissues of a particular protein are displayed by a summary page including all 48 tissues analyzed (Fig. 4, a and b). Intensity and abundance of immunoreactivity are given as a color code from white (no protein presence) to red (high amounts of protein). Each colored circle represents an annotated tissue type, and the circles can be clicked to show the underlying original images.Fig. 4The summary page for normal protein profiles. Two examples of the summary page for normal tissue profiles in 48 different normal tissues are shown. Intensity and abundance of immunoreactivity is given as a color code (red = strong, orange = moderate, yellow = weak, white = no staining, and black = missing tissue). Each colored circle represents one tissue type. The circles are divided in three because each tissue is represented by samples from three different patients. Two examples of normal tissue profiles obtained with antibodies are shown: a, the antibody HPR000701 directed toward the MAT1 gene product from chromosome 14; and b, the antibody HPR001012 directed toward the ARHGAP4gene product from the X chromosome. One example of a TMA spot from normal testis stained with an antibody generated from the MAT1gene is shown at low (c) and at high magnification (d). Similarly a TMA spot showing immunohistochemical outcome from the ARHGAP4 gene is shown at low (e) and high magnification (f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The summary results from the antibody HPR000701 toward the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase assembly factor MAT1 protein show a weak or moderate expression pattern in a majority of analyzed cell types, whereas a strong expression is detected in testis and urinary bladder (Fig. 4a). This gene product contains a type 1 RING-type zinc finger, and the protein is reported to be involved in cell cycle control and RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II (14Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F.

    "text":"Optical modeling of the upper ocean in relation to its biogenous matter content (case I waters). The aim of the present study is to review and tentatively to interpret the optical behavior of oceanic case I waters, those waters for which phytoplankton and their derivative play a predominant role in determining their optical properties. Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.",

In the present study we have introduced a new scheme for chemical bond analysis by combining the Extended Transition State (ETS) method [ Theor. Chim.

The ETS-NOCV charge and energy decomposition scheme based on the Kohn-Sham approach makes it not only possible to decompose the deformation density, \u0394\u03c1, into the different components (such as \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03b4, etc.) of the chemical bond, but it also provides the corresponding energy contributions to the total bond energy. Thus, the ETS-NOCV scheme offers a compact, qualitative, and quantitative picture of the chemical bond formation within one common theoretical framework. Although, the ETS-NOCV approach contains a certain arbitrariness in the definition of the molecular subsystems that constitute the whole molecule, it can be widely used for the description of different types of chemical bonds. The applicability of the ETS-NOCV scheme is demonstrated for single (H3X-XH3, for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn) and multiple (H2X\u2550XH2, H3CX\u2261XCH3, for X = C, Ge) covalent bonds between main group elements, for sextuple and quadruple bonds between metal centers (Cr2, Mo2, W2, [Cl4CrCrCl4](4-)), and for double bonds between a metal and a main group element ((CO)5Cr\u2550XH2, for X = C, Si, Ge, Sn).

Endothelial cells form the inner lining of the vessel wall, and perivascular cells\u2014referred to as pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells or mural cells\u2014envelop the surface of the vascular tube. Over the last decades, studies of blood vessels have concentrated mainly on the endothelial cell component, especially when the first angiogenic factors were discovered, while the interest in pericytes has lagged behind. Pericytes are, however, functionally significant; when vessels lose pericytes, they become hemorrhagic and hyperdilated, which leads to conditions such as edema, diabetic retinopathy, and even embryonic lethality. Recently, pericytes have gained new attention as functional and critical contributors to tumor angiogenesis and therefore as potential new targets for antiangiogenic therapies. Pericytes are complex. Their ontogeny is not completely understood, and they perform various functions throughout the body. This review article describes the current knowledge about the nature of pericytes and their functions during vessel growth, vessel maintenance, and pathological angiogenesis.",

In both domains, risk varies from low to high with threats coming from a variety of sources in the environment. Safety is paramount for both professions, but cost issues can influence the commitment of resources for safety efforts. Aircraft accidents are infrequent, highly visible, and often involve massive loss of life, resulting in exhaustive investigation into causal factors, public reports, and remedial action. Research by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into aviation accidents has found that 70% involve human error.1\n\nIn contrast, medical adverse events happen to individual patients and seldom receive national publicity.

Most researchers agree that soil cover methods offer the most useful approach to measuring nitrous oxide (N2O) exchange in the field, but there is little uniformity in the design of covers used by them. The cover design least subject to the potential errors associated with this approach is a vented enclosure with either closed-loop air circulation or no forced air circulation. Although the soil N2O concentration gradient beneath these covers decreases with time as the gas accumulates, this problem can be overcome by a proposed change in the equation for computing flux from the increase in head-space N2O concentration. Over a broad range of sampling conditions, N2O fluxes computed from the new equation were independent of the time allowed for N2O accumulation. Other equations were developed that predict optimum soil cover vent dimensions for effectively transmitting ambient pressure fluctuations to the enclosed space while minimizing loss of the accumulating N2O by diffusion to the outside. Soil covers with vent dimensions dictated by the equations had N2O accumulation rates significantly higher than covers with 60% smaller vent diameters but not significantly different than covers with 60% larger vent diameters.",

Conversely, biospheric environmental perturbations, including nutrient enrichment and climatic changes (e.g. global warming, hydrologic changes, increased frequencies and intensities of tropical cyclones, more intense and persistent droughts), strongly affect cyanobacterial growth and bloom potentials in freshwater and marine ecosystems. We examined human and climatic controls on harmful (toxic, hypoxia-generating, food web disrupting) bloom-forming cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) along the freshwater to marine continuum. These changes may act synergistically to promote cyanobacterial dominance and persistence. This synergy is a formidable challenge to water quality, water supply and fisheries managers, because bloom potentials and controls may be altered in response to contemporaneous changes in thermal and hydrologic regimes. In inland waters, hydrologic modifications, including enhanced vertical mixing and, if water supplies permit, increased flushing (reducing residence time) will likely be needed in systems where nutrient input reductions are neither feasible nor possible.

Here we describe a molecular mechanism linking ULK to the pro-autophagic lipid kinase VPS34. Following amino-acid starvation or mTOR inhibition, the activated ULK1 phosphorylates Beclin-1 on Ser 14, thereby enhancing the activity of the ATG14L-containing VPS34 complexes. The Beclin-1 Ser 14 phosphorylation by ULK is required for full autophagic induction in mammals and this requirement is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Abstract A consequence of all aerobic life is the production of potentially harmful, partially reduced species of molecular oxygen (oxyradicals) that occurs as a result of normal oxygen metabolism. In view of this potential for harm, aerobic organisms have evolved a complex armamentorium of defenses to protect them against the possible ravages of oxyradical production. A recent growing body of evidence indicates a marked penchant for augmented oxyradical production in aquatic organisms resulting largely from anthropogenic pollutant outfalls. Two consequences of environmental contamination might be envisaged; certain compounds which cause increased oxyradical flux could exacerbate the deleterious effects of oxyradicals or the increased fluxes could affect induction of antioxidant enzymes thereby overcoming the stresses imposed by the contaminating compound(s). This review describes the various adaptational mechanisms and responses, including the toxicological consequences, associated with oxyradical production. The broad phylogenetic spectrum of examples discussed herein illustrate that while there are numerous differences among the phyla with respect to both pro- and anti-oxidant mechanisms to establish a vigorous basis of inquiry, enough striking similarities also exist to suggest the use of aquatic organisms as alternative models to mammals in various areas of oxyradical research, e.g. aging and cancer. In addition, the potential use of anti-oxidant responses, e.g. induction of specific anti-oxidant enzymes as biomarkers of environmental contamination is reviewed.",

We used a Delphi approach in which a series of questionnaires were distributed to a panel of experts in experimental lung injury. The Committee concluded that the main features of experimental ALI include histological evidence of tissue injury, alteration of the alveolar capillary barrier, presence of an inflammatory response, and evidence of physiological dysfunction; they recommended that, to determine if ALI has occurred, at least three of these four main features of ALI should be present. The Committee also identified key \"very relevant\" and \"somewhat relevant\" measurements for each of the main features of ALI and recommended the use of least one \"very relevant\" measurement and preferably one or two additional separate measurements to determine if a main feature of ALI is present. Finally, the Committee emphasized that not all of the measurements listed can or should be performed in every study, and that measurements not included in the list are by no means \"irrelevant.\" Our list of features and measurements of ALI is intended as a guide for investigators, and ultimately investigators should choose the particular measurements that best suit the experimental questions being addressed as well as take into consideration any unique aspects of the experimental design.",

More recently, an improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis has given rise to new treatment options, including targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy. Targeted approaches aim to inhibit molecular pathways that are crucial for tumour growth and maintenance; whereas, immunotherapy endeavours to stimulate a host immune response that effectuates long-lived tumour destruction.

    "text":"Green composites from sustainable cellulose nanofibrils: A review. Abstract Green composites are materials having ecofriendly attributes that are technically and economically feasible while minimizing the generation of pollution. In this context it refers to the combination of fully degradable fibers mostly cellulosic materials and natural resins to develop green composite materials. In the past decade, overdependence on petroleum products (synthetic polymers, resins, etc.) has consistently increased and on account of this, the researchers are now focusing more on green materials specially cellulosics. Cellulosic fibers in micro and nano scale are attractive to replace man-made fibers as reinforcement to make environmentally friendly green products. In this study, we will discuss the processing, extraction, properties, chronological events and applications of cellulose and cellulosic-based nanocomposite materials. Cellulosic nanocomposites are currently considered one of the most promising areas of scientific and technological development in the field of plant products. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the current state of development in the field of cellulose nanofibril based green composites research and application through examples.",

Starvation-induced autophagosomes engulf cytosol and\/or organelles and deliver them to lysosomes for degradation, thereby resupplying depleted nutrients.

The early autophagosomal marker, Atg5, transiently localizes to punctae on mitochondria, followed by the late autophagosomal marker, LC3.

Mitochondria thus play a central role in starvation-induced autophagy, contributing membrane to autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are derived from mitochondrial outer membrane during starvation Lipids, but not most proteins, are transferred from mitochondria to autophagosomes Mitochondria-ER connections are required to form autophagosomes during starvation Mitochondrial contribution to autophagosome assembly is unique to starvation During starvation, many organisms retrieve nutrients via degradation of their own intracellular components. This process is termed macroautophagy, or simply autophagy\u2014\u201cself eating.\u201d Autophagy is initiated by formation of multilamellar organelles that engulf cytosol en masse. Lysosomes subsequently fuse with autophagosomes and deliver lysosomal proteases. Captured substrates are thereby degraded, and transporters and permeases in the membrane move components released by catabolism back to the cytosol (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Autophagy during starvation is utilized throughout the eukaryotic domain. S. cerevisiae autophagy mutants rapidly die when cells are deprived of nitrogen and carbon (Scott et al., 1996Scott S.V.

Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. The role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). An important question regarding starvation-induced autophagosomes is where these organelles originate from. Nearly all proteins involved in inception and maturation of autophagosomes are cytosolic proteins that are recruited to membranes (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Proteomic studies have identified peripheral proteins but not a clear signature of membrane origin (Overbye et al., 2007Overbye A. Fengsrud M. Seglen P.O. Proteomic analysis of membrane-associated proteins from rat liver autophagosomes.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 300-322PubMed Google Scholar), and reports have implicated membrane contribution from disparate sources including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trans Golgi network (TGN) and mitochondria (Axe et al., 2008Axe E.L.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3888-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (EM) tomography has revealed close apposition of ER and phagophore membranes, most apparent when phagophore maturation is blocked (Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009Hayashi-Nishino M. Fujita N. Noda T. Yamaguchi A. Toshimori T. Yamamoto A. A subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum forms a cradle for autophagosome formation.Nat.

Eskelinen E.L. 3D tomotgraphy redeals connections between the phagophore and endoplasmic reticulum.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These studies implicate involvement of the ER in autophagy, but it remains unclear whether this is a specific form of autophagy\u2013ER-phagy\u2013or whether the ER contributes to all autophagosome formation (Reggiori and Tooze, 2009Reggiori F. Tooze S.A. The EmERgence of autophagosomes.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 747-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because different membranes have been implicated in autophagosome biogenesis, it is possible the membrane origin of autophagosomes is variable. Here, we investigate formation of starvation-induced autophagosomes and uncover a mechanism involving contribution from the outer membrane of mitochondria that occurs during starvation but not ER stress. We show mitochondrial-derived membranes are utilized during autophagy and that autophagosome formation is dependent on ER\/mitochondria connections modulated by mitofusin2 (Mfn2). These connections likely replenish mitochondrial lipid utilized for autophagic growth. We further identify a lipid anchor sequence that allows transfer of proteins from mitochondria to autophagosomes. Starvation-induced autophagosomes were studied in a clonal Normal Rat Kidney cell line expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to LC3 (line NRK58B). LC3 (MAP1LC3, rat homolog of S. cerevisiae Atg8p) is a canonical autophagosome marker (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, Mizushima et al., 2004Mizushima N.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Under replete growth conditions, CFP-LC3 was distributed between cytosolic and nuclear pools, with very little observed on autophagic membranes. Replacement of growth media with DPBS, HBSS or serum-free media induced a starvation response, and CFP-LC3 was recruited to autophagosomal membranes (Figure 1A ). Cells starved for 2 hr accumulated on average \u223c50 CFP-LC3-labeled autophagic structures with very reproducible kinetics (Figure 1B). This response required Vps34\/Beclin Class III PI3 kinase activity\u2013an upstream event in autophagosome formation (Furuya et al., 2005Furuya N. Yu J. Byfield M. Pattingre S. Levine B. The evolutionarily conserved domain of Beclin 1 is required for Vps34 binding, autophagy and tumor suppressor function.Autophagy. 2005; 1: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). NRK58B cells starved in the presence of 10 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of the kinase complex (Petiot et al., 2000Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Distinct classes of phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinases are involved in signaling pathways that control macroautophagy in HT-29 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), failed to recruit CFP-LC3 to punctae. Treated cells showed CFP-LC3 predominately in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Subsequent washout of 3-MA restored the ability to induce autophagy during starvation (Figures 1C and 1D). Starvation induced autophagosomes also showed sequential recruitment of Atg5 (mouse mAtg5) and LC3. Atg5 marks sites of initial autophagosome formation and is necessary for recruitment of LC3 during starvation (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). We observed rapid accumulation of YFP-Atg5, followed by abrupt loss at punctae (Figure 1E; Movie S1 available online). YFP-Atg5 persisted for \u223c3 min, and release always occurred concurrently with accumulation of CFP-LC3 (Figures 1E and 1F). We charted the intracellular locations of YFP-Atg5 and found that autophagosome assembly occurs at sites dispersed throughout the cell (Figure 1G). Autophagosomes generated by starvation captured cytosolic components. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an autophagy substrate (Hoyvik et al., 1991Hoyvik H. Gordon P.B. Berg T.O. Stromhaug P.E. Seglen P.O. Inhibition of autophagic-lysosomal delivery and autophagic lactolysis by asparagine.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Sneve et al., 2005Sneve M.L. Overbye A. Fengsrud M. Seglen P.O. Comigration of two autophagosome-associated dehydrogenases on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels.Autophagy. 2005; 1: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was expressed in nutrient-deprived NRK58B cells. Signal from freely diffusing GAPDH-YFP molecules was depleted by repetitively photobleaching a small region of cytosol to reveal non-diffusing subpopulations of GAPDH-YFP in punctae. These co-localized with lysosomal markers (not shown) or CFP-LC3 (Figure 1H), indicating autophagosomes with trapped cytosolic substrate. Autophagosomes in starved NRK58B were further characterized by LysoTracker labeling to visualize fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes. Upon fusion, LysoTracker signal accumulated in CFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes. Soon thereafter, CFP-LC3 signal from these structures was lost (Figure 2A ; Movie S2). The lifetime of starvation-induced autophagosomes was examined using photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. A photoactivatable GFP for selective photolabeling of proteins and cells.Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), which is invisible until activated by \u223c400-nm irrradiation. PAGFP-LC3 can be used to pulse-label and monitor an autophagosome population (Hailey and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2009Hailey D.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Using photoactivatable proteins to monitor autophagysome lifetime.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NRK cells expressing PAGFP-LC3 were starved, photoactivated, and monitored by live cell imaging. Starvation-induced autophagosomes exhibited near complete turnover within 40 min. Loss of PAGFP-LC3 signal was not due to photobleaching or release of PAGFP-LC3 from autophagosomes prior to lysosomal fusion, since loss of signal was blocked by treatment with chloroquine to inactivate lysosomal proteases and block fusion with lysosomes (Figures 2B and 2C; Movie S3) (Bjorkoy et al., 2005Bjorkoy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62\/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar, Tasdemir et al., 2008Tasdemir E. Galluzzi L. Maiuri M.C. Criollo A. Vitale I. Hangen E. Modjtahedi N. Kroemer G. Methods for assessing autophagy and autophagic cell death.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that starvation-induced autophagosomes in NRK58B cells are bona fide autophagosomes. They require Class III PI3Kinase activity and exhibit subsequent Atg5 and LC3 recruitment. These autophagosomes assemble at sites scattered throughout the cell, capture cytosolic substrates, and rapidly turn over in a lysosomal dependent fashion. To identify membranes contributing to autophagosome formation, a battery of YFP-fusion proteins targeted to different intracellular organelles were expressed in NRK58B cells. We reasoned that if the membrane of an organelle was utilized for autophagosome formation, chimeric markers targeted to this membrane might be transferred to the induced autophagosomes. Markers tested included those for the Golgi apparatus, TGN, early endosomal system, plasma membrane, ER, and mitochondria. Tested ER markers included YFP fused to the targeting sequence of ER cytochrome b5, called YFP-ERcb5TM. The targeting sequence of an isoform of cytochrome b5 (cb5) that labels the outer mitochondrial membrane tagged with YFP, called YFP-Mitocb5TM was used to label mitochondria. This cb5 isoform has a shorter transmembrane region and positively charged residues at its distal C terminus than the cb5 isoform targeted to the ER\u2013differences necessary and sufficient to target it specifically to the mitochondria outer membrane (Borgese et al., 2001Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Targeting of a tail-anchored protein to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane by independent but competing pathways.Mol. Biol.

There was no YFP-ERcb5TM signal in mitochondrial membranes, and no YFP-Mitocb5TM signal in ER membranes (Figure S1). Most surveyed organelles revealed little or no overlap with CFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes (Figures 3A and 3B ). For ER markers including YFP-ERcb5TM, regions of low ER density showed no overlap with CFP-LC3 (Figure 3A, insets). Because the ER is continuous, we also used repetitive photobleaching of a small region to deplete signal from the entire ER network. Following bleaching, these ER markers were not detected in starvation-induced autophagosomes, suggesting no transfer of ER markers to autophagosomes had taken place. (Figure S2).Figure 3Evaluating Membrane-Targeted Markers for Transfer to AutophagosomesShow full caption(A) Expression of YFP-tagged membrane markers in starved NRK58B cells.

The scale bar represents 5 \u03bcm. Only the YFP-Mitocb5TM mitochondrial outer membrane marker showed extensive overlap with autophagosomes. YFP-Mitocb5TM was present on nearly 80% of CFP-LC3 positive autophagosomes after a 2 hr starvation (Figures 3A and 3B). Notably, this observation was specific to starvation-induced autophagy. YFP-Mitocb5TM did not colocalize with autophagosomes formed in response to ER stress and calcium perturbation (Figure S3). YFP-Mitocb5TM stably associated with autophagic membranes. Photobleaching YFP-Mitocb5TM signal was used to deplete all signal except that present on isolated autophagic vesicles. YFP-Mitocb5TM showed persistent signal on these isolated autophagosomes for > 3 min (Figure 3C). We next asked whether overlap of YFP-Mitocb5TM mitochondrial outer membrane marker with the autophagic marker was due to induction of mitophagy, a process wherein mitochondria are captured and degraded (Mijaljica et al., 2007Mijaljica D. Prescott M. Devenish R.J. Different fates of mitochondria: alternative ways for degradation?.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 4-9PubMed Google Scholar). This predicts more overlap of matrix and inner membrane mitochondrial markers with CFP-LC3 positive structures compared to an outer mitochondrial marker. We thus evaluated co-localization of mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane markers with CFP-LC3 after autophagic induction. Mitochondrial matrix was labeled with yellow fluorescent protein fused to the targeting sequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. Inner membrane was labeled with 10N-nonyl acridine orange (a dye that binds cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Petit et al., 1992Petit J.M. Maftah A. Ratinaud M.H. Julien R. 10N-nonyl acridine orange interacts with cardiolipin and allows the quantification of this phospholipid in isolated mitochondria.Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Neither marker showed a comparable degree of overlap with the autophagosomal marker after starvation (Figures 4A and 4B ). Similarly, the inner membrane marker Prohibitin-YFP showed dramatically less autophagosome-associated signal (Figure 4B). Contrary to what mitophagy predicts, matrix and inner mitochondrial markers did not overlap with CFP-LC3-positive structures induced by starvation. Mitophagy also predicts mitochondrial components should be captured inside autophagosomes. To test this, we examined autophagosomes in cells expressing YFP-Mitocb5TM and GAPDH-RFP. High-resolution imaging resolved isolation membranes of autophagosomes around sequestered GAPDH-RFP signal (Figure 4C). Line profiles of GAPDH-RFP within autophagosomes exhibited single bell-shaped intensity profiles, consistent with soluble protein trapped in the lumen of the autophagosomes. By contrast, YFP-Mitocb5TM showed well-delineated intensity peaks at the limiting membranes of autophagic vesicles (Figure 4D). This indicated that YFP-Mitocb5TM in autophagosomes was present on limiting membranes of autophagosomes, and that the autophagosome lumens contained cytosolic components, not mitochondria. Finally, we compared starvation with conditions known to induce mitophagy. Mitophagy can be induced by staurosporine\/ Z-VAD-FMK treatment to simultaneously damage mitochondria and inhibit pan-caspase activity (Colell et al., 2007Colell A. Ricci J.E. Tait S. Milasta S. Maurer U. Bouchier-Hayes L. Fitzgerald P. Guio-Carrion A. Waterhouse N.J. Li C.W. et al.GAPDH and autophagy preserve survival after apoptotic cytochrome c release in the absence of caspase activation.Cell. 2007; 129: 983-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In these conditions, flow cytometry revealed loss of mitochondrial mass in a significant fraction of treated cells. Additionally, we observed autophagosomes in treated NRK58B cells that captured both mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. Starvation, in contrast, produced neither appreciable loss of mitochondrial mass nor apparent capture of entire mitochondria (Figure 4; Figure S4). We concluded that mitophagy does not underlie the presence of YFP-Mitocb5TM in autophagosomal membranes during starvation in our system. We next considered other scenarios that could result in overlap of the mitochondrial outer membrane marker with the autophagosome marker. One possibility is that mitochondrial outer membrane is used in autophagosome biogenesis. We asked if we could visualize outgrowth of autophagosomes from mitochondria. Starved NRK cells expressing GFP-LC3 and Mito-RFP revealed GFP-LC3 punctae that first formed in association with mitochondria and retained that association despite highly dynamic mitochondrial movements (Figure 5A ; Movie S4). Another autophagosome marker GFP-Atg5 showed similar behavior. Membrane association of the Atg5\/Atg12\/Atg16 complex is a prerequisite for LC3 recruitment to membranes (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K.

In starved NRK cells, GFP-Atg5 punctae first appeared along mitochondrial elements and persisted along these elements through their lifetime (Figure S5, Figure S6; Movie S5).Figure S5Live-Cell Imaging of GFP-LC3-Labeled Autophagosomes and Associated Mitochondrial Elements, Related to Figure 5Show full captionNRK cells were transfected with the mitochondria matrix marker Mito-RFP and autophagosome marker GFP-Atg5 and subsequently starved.

    "text":"What would it take for renewably powered electrosynthesis to displace petrochemical processes?. BACKGROUND As the world continues to transition toward carbon emissions\u2013free energy technologies, there remains a need to also reduce the carbon emissions of the chemical production industry. Today many of the world\u2019s chemicals are produced from fossil fuel\u2013derived feedstocks. Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into chemical feedstocks offers a way to turn waste emissions into valuable products, closing the carbon loop. When coupled to renewable sources of electricity, these products can be made with a net negative carbon emissions footprint, helping to sequester CO 2 into usable goods. Research and development into electrocatalytic materials for CO 2 reduction has intensified in recent years, with advances in selectivity, efficiency, and reaction rate progressing toward practical implementation. A variety of chemical products can be made from CO 2 , such as alcohols, oxygenates, synthesis gas (syngas), and olefins\u2014staples in the global chemical industry. Because these products are produced at substantial scale, a switch to renewably powered production could result in a substantial carbon emissions reduction impact. The advancement of electrochemical technology to convert electrons generated from renewable power into stable chemical form also represents one avenue to long-term (e.g., seasonal) storage of energy. ADVANCES The science of electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction continues to progress, with priority given to the need to pinpoint more accurately the targets for practical application, the economics of chemical products, and barriers to market entry. It will be important to scale CO 2 electrolyzers and increase the stability of these catalysts to thousands of hours of continuous operation. Product separation and efficient recycling of CO 2 and electrolyte also need to be managed. The petrochemical industry operates at a massive scale with a complicated global supply chain and heavy capital costs. Commodity chemical markets are difficult to penetrate and are priced on feedstock, which is currently inexpensive as a result of the shale gas boom. CO 2 capture costs from the flue or direct air and product separation from unreacted CO 2 are also important to consider. Assuming that the advancement of electrocatalytic technologies continues apace, what will it take to disrupt the chemical production sector, and what will society gain by doing so? This review presents a technoeconomic and carbon emissions assessment of CO 2 products such as ethylene, ethanol, and carbon monoxide, offering target figures of merit for practical application. The price of electricity is by far the largest cost driver. Electrochemical production costs begin to match those of traditional fossil fuel\u2013derived processes when electricity prices fall below 4 cents per kWh and energy conversion efficiencies reach at least 60%. When powered by renewable electricity, these products can be made with a net negative carbon emissions footprint. A comparative analysis of electrocatalytic, biocatalytic, and fossil fuel\u2013derived chemical production shows that electrocatalytic production has the potential to yield the greatest reduction in carbon emissions, provided that a steady supply of clean electricity is available. Additionally, opportunities exist to combine electrochemical conversion of CO 2 with a range of other thermo- and biocatalytic processes to slowly electrify the existing petrochemical supply chain and further upgrade CO 2 into more useful chemicals. Technical challenges such as operating lifetime, energy efficiency, and product separation are discussed. Supply chain management of products and entrenched industrial petrochemical competition are also considered. OUTLOOK There exists increasingly widespread recognition of the need to transition to carbon emissions\u2013free means of chemical production. CO 2 pricing mechanisms are being developed and are seeing increased governmental support. The nascent carbon utilization economy is gaining traction, with startup companies, global prizes, and industrial research efforts all pursuing new carbon conversion technologies. Recent advances in electrochemical CO 2 reduction through the use of gas diffusion electrodes are pushing current densities and selectivities into a realm of industrial use. Despite this progress, there remain technical challenges that must be overcome for commercial application. Additionally, market barriers and cost economics will ultimately decide whether this technology experiences widespread implementation. Electrochemical CO 2 conversion. Reduction of CO 2 using renewably sourced electricity could transform waste CO 2 emissions into commodity chemical feedstocks or fuels.",

Dynamic remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for development, wound healing and normal organ homeostasis.

Fibrotic diseases, which include pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, liver cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease, account for over 45% of deaths in the developed world. ECM remodeling is also crucial for tumor malignancy and metastatic progression, which ultimately cause over 90% of deaths from cancer. Here, we discuss current methodologies and models for understanding and quantifying the impact of environmental cues provided by the ECM on disease progression, and how improving our understanding of ECM remodeling in these pathological conditions is crucial for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.

    "text":"Chemistry of Covalent Organic Frameworks. Linking organic molecules by covalent bonds into extended solids typically generates amorphous, disordered materials. The ability to develop strategies for obtaining crystals of such solids is of interest because it opens the way for precise control of the geometry and functionality of the extended structure, and the stereochemical orientation of its constituents. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of porous covalent organic structures whose backbone is composed entirely of light elements (B, C, N, O, Si) that represent a successful demonstration of how crystalline materials of covalent solids can be achieved. COFs are made by combination of organic building units covalently linked into extended structures to make crystalline materials. The attainment of crystals is done by several techniques in which a balance is struck between the thermodynamic reversibility of the linking reactions and their kinetics. This success has led to the expansion of COF materials to include organic units linked by these strong covalent bonds: B-O, C-N, B-N, and B-O-Si. Since the organic constituents of COFs, when linked, do not undergo significant change in their overall geometry, it has been possible to predict the structures of the resulting COFs, and this advantage has facilitated their characterization using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) techniques. It has also allowed for the synthesis of COF structures by design and for their formation with the desired composition, pore size, and aperture. In practice, the modeled PXRD pattern for a given expected COF is compared with the experimental one, and depending on the quality of the match, this is used as a starting point for solving and then refining the crystal structure of the target COF. These characteristics make COFs an attractive class of new porous materials. Accordingly, they have been used as gas storage materials for energy applications, solid supports for catalysis, and optoelectronic devices. A large and growing library of linkers amenable to the synthesis of COFs is now available, and new COFs and topologies made by reticular synthesis are being reported. Much research is also directed toward the development of new methods of linking organic building units to generate other crystalline COFs. These efforts promise not only new COF chemistry and materials, but also the chance to extend the precision of molecular covalent chemistry to extended solids.",

Permanent Scatterer SAR Interferometry (PSInSAR) aims to identify coherent radar targets exhibiting high phase stability over the entire observation time period. These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly \u201csqueezed\u201d to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values.

First, we used an MRI approach to generate CBV maps over time in the hippocampal formation of exercising mice. Among all hippocampal subregions, exercise was found to have a primary effect on dentate gyrus CBV, the only subregion that supports adult neurogenesis. Moreover, exercise-induced increases in dentate gyrus CBV were found to correlate with postmortem measurements of neurogenesis. Second, using similar MRI technologies, we generated CBV maps over time in the hippocampal formation of exercising humans. As in mice, exercise was found to have a primary effect on dentate gyrus CBV, and the CBV changes were found to selectively correlate with cardiopulmonary and cognitive function. Taken together, these findings show that dentate gyrus CBV provides an imaging correlate of exercise-induced neurogenesis and that exercise differentially targets the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subregion important for memory and implicated in cognitive aging.",

Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes (> 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01\u20130.07 \u03c3) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1\u20130.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.",

Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.",

Abstract This study aims to understand through statistical learning the basic biophysical mechanisms behind three-dimensional folding of epigenomes. The 3DEpiLoop algorithm predicts three-dimensional chromatin looping interactions within topologically associating domains (TADs) from one-dimensional epigenomics and transcription factor profiles using the statistical learning. The predictions obtained by 3DEpiLoop are highly consistent with the reported experimental interactions. The complex signatures of epigenomic and transcription factors within the physically interacting chromatin regions (anchors) are similar across all genomic scales: genomic domains, chromosomal territories, cell types, and different individuals. We report the most important epigenetic and transcription factor features used for interaction identification either shared, or unique for each of sixteen (16) cell lines. The analysis shows that CTCF interaction anchors are enriched by transcription factors yet deficient in histone modifications, while the opposite is true in the case of RNAP II mediated interactions.

Abstract As renewed attention has been given by policy makers to energy conservation issues, it has frequently been asserted that an energy-efficiency gap exists between actual and optimal energy use. The critical questions is how to define the optimal level of energy efficiency. This paper seeks to disentangle some confusing strands of argument that are frequently brought to bear on this question, by identifying the major conceptual issues that determine the set of feasible answers. We identify five separate and distinct notions of optimality: the economists' economic potential, the technologists' economic potential, hypothetical potential, the narrow social optimum and the true social optimum. Each of these has associated with it a corresponding definition of the energy-efficiency gap. Our analysis demonstrates that necessary preconditions for identifying the right measure of the energy-efficiency gap include understanding and disentangling market failure and non-market failure explanations for the gradual diffusion of energy-efficient technologies.",

Simulated with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), RCP4.5 includes long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases, short-lived species, and land-use-land-cover in a global economic framework. RCP4.5 was updated from earlier GCAM scenarios to incorporate historical emissions and land cover information common to the RCP process and follows a cost-minimizing pathway to reach the target radiative forcing. The imperative to limit emissions in order to reach this target drives changes in the energy system, including shifts to electricity, to lower emissions energy technologies and to the deployment of carbon capture and geologic storage technology. In addition, the RCP4.5 emissions price also applies to land use emissions; as a result, forest lands expand from their present day extent. The simulated future emissions and land use were downscaled from the regional simulation to a grid to facilitate transfer to climate models.

Eddy covariance technique to measure CO2, water and energy fluxes between biosphere and atmosphere is widely spread and used in various regional networks. Currently more than 250 eddy covariance sites are active around the world measuring carbon exchange at high temporal resolution for different biomes and climatic conditions. In this paper a new standardized set of corrections is introduced and the uncertainties associated with these corrections are assessed for eight different forest sites in Europe with a total of 12 yearly datasets. The uncertainties introduced on the two components GPP (Gross Primary Production) and TER (Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration) are also discussed and a quantitative analysis presented. Through a factorial analysis we find that generally, uncertainties by different corrections are additive without interactions and that the heuristic u*-correction introduces the largest uncertainty. The results show that a standardized data processing is needed for an effective comparison across biomes and for underpinning inter-annual variability. The methodology presented in this paper has also been integrated in the European database of the eddy covariance measurements.",

To induce autophagy, cells were transferred from Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 12% fetal calf serum into Hanks' balanced salt solution. When bafilomycin A1 was added to Hanks' balanced salt solution, endogenous protein degradation was strongly inhibited and numerous autophagosomes accumulated in H-4-II-E cells, whereas autolysosomes decreased in number. Acid phosphatase activity was not detected in the autophagosomes which accumulated in the presence of bafilomycin A1, suggesting that fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes was disturbed by this drug. Inhibition of the fusion was reversible, and the autophagosomes changed into autolysosomes after the removal of the inhibitor. Bafilomycin A1 also prevented the appearance of endocytosed HRP in autophagic vacuoles.

The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this critical review. CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approximate atmospheric pressures. Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore volumes of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, respectively. Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4. Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites. In addition, strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and\/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chemical bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement. Besides the advantages, two main challenges of using MOFs in CO2 capture, the cost of synthesis and the stability toward water vapor, have been analyzed and possible solutions and path forward have been proposed to address the two challenges as well (150 references).",

This presentation is a concept review paper dealing with a central dilemma in understanding, designing, and acting upon crop plant improvement programs for drought conditions. The association among yield potential (YP), drought resistance (DR), and water-use efficiency (WUE) is often misunderstood, which in turn can lead to conceptual oversight and wrong decisions in implementing breeding programs for drought-prone environments. Although high YP is the target of most crop breeding programs, it might not be compatible with superior DR. On the other hand, high YP can contribute to yield in moderate stress environments. Plant production in water-limited environments is very often affected by constitutive plant traits that allow maintenance of a high plant water status (dehydration avoidance). Osmotic adjustment (OA) is a major cellular stress adaptive response in certain crop plants that enhances dehydration avoidance and supports yield under stress. Despite past voiced speculations, there is no proof that OA entails a cost in terms of reduced YP. WUE for yield is often equated in a simplistic manner with DR. The large accumulation of knowledge on crop WUE as derived from research on carbon isotope discrimination allows some conclusions on the relations between WUE on the one hand, and DR and YP on the other, to be made. Briefly, apparent genotypic variations in WUE are normally expressed mainly due to variations in water use (WU; the denominator). Reduced WU, which is reflected in higher WUE, is generally achieved by plant traits and environmental responses that reduce YP. Improved WUE on the basis of reduced WU is expressed in improved yield under water-limited conditions only when there is need to balance crop water use against a limited and known soil moisture reserve. However, under most dryland situations where crops depend on unpredictable seasonal rainfall, the maximisation of soil moisture use is a crucial component of drought resistance (avoidance), which is generally expressed in lower WUE. It is concluded that the effect of a single \u2018drought adaptive\u2019 gene on crop performance in water-limited environments can be assessed only when the whole system is considered in terms of YP, DR, and WUE.",

Two Divisions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), namely Physical Chemistry (Commission 1.7 on Biophysical Chemistry formerly Steering Committee on Biophysical Chemistry) and Analytical Chemistry (Commission V.5 on Electroanalytical Chemistry) have prepared recommendations on the definition, classification and nomenclature related to electrochemical biosensors: these recommendations could, in the future, be extended to other types of biosensors. An electrochemical biosensor is a self-contained integrated device, which is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) which is retained in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element. Because of their ability to be repeatedly calibrated, we recommend that a biosensor should be clearly distinguished from a bioanalytical system, which requires additional processing steps, such as reagent addition. A device that is both disposable after one measurement, i.e. single use, and unable to monitor the analyte concentration continuously or after rapid and reproducible regeneration, should be designated a single use biosensor. Biosensors may be classified according to the biological specificity-conferring mechanism or, alternatively, to the mode of physico-chemical signal transduction. The biological recognition element may be based on a chemical reaction catalysed by, or on an equilibrium reaction with macromolecules that have been isolated, engineered or present in their original biological environment. In the latter cases. equilibrium is generally reached and there is no further, if any, net consumption of analyte(s) by the immobilized biocomplexing agent incorporated into the sensor. Biosensors may be further classified according to the analytes or reactions that they monitor: direct monitoring of analyte concentration or of reactions producing or consuming such analytes; alternatively, an indirect monitoring of inhibitor or activator of the biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) may be achieved. A rapid proliferation of biosensors and their diversity has led to a lack of rigour in defining their performance criteria. Although each biosensor can only truly be evaluated for a particular application, it is still useful to examine how standard protocols for performance criteria may be defined in accordance with standard IUPAC protocols or definitions. These criteria are recommended for authors. referees and educators and include calibration characteristics (sensitivity, operational and linear concentration range, detection and quantitative determination limits), selectivity, steady-state and transient response times, sample throughput, reproducibility, stability and lifetime.",

After five recycles for the photodegradation of rhodamine B, the catalyst did not exhibit any significant loss of activity, confirming the photocatalyst is essentially stable. The total organic carbon measurement displayed that a high degree of mineralization was achieved in the present photochemical system.

New versions of all the gridded datasets currently available on the CRU Web site (http:\/\/ www.cru.uea.ac.uk) have been developed. This includes combinations with marine (sea surface temperature anomalies) data over the oceans and versions with adjustment of the variance of individual gridbox series to remove the effects of changing station numbers through time. Hemispheric and global temperature averages for land areas developed with the new dataset differ slightly from those developed in 1994. Possible reasons for the differences between the new and the earlier analysis and those from the National Climatic Data Center and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are discussed. Differences are greatest over the Southern Hemisphere and at the beginnings and ends of each time series and relate to gridbox sizes and data availability. The rate of annual warming for global land areas over the 1901\u2010 2000 period is estimated by least squares to be 0.078C decade21 (significant at better than the 99.9% level). Warming is not continuous but occurs principally over two periods (about 1920\u201045 and since 1975). Annual temperature series for the seven continents and the Arctic all show significant warming over the twentieth century, with significant (95%) warming for 1920\u201044 for North America, the Arctic, Africa, and South America, and all continents except Australia and the Antarctic since 1977. Cooling is significant during the intervening period (1945\u201076) for North America, the Arctic, and Africa.",

Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.",

Abstract External confinement by the wrapping of FRP sheets (or FRP jacketing) provides a very effective method for the retrofit of reinforced concrete (RC) columns subject to either static or seismic loads. For the reliable and cost-effective design of FRP jackets, an accurate stress\u2013strain model is required for FRP-confined concrete. In this paper, a new design-oriented stress\u2013strain model is proposed for concrete confined by FRP wraps with fibres only or predominantly in the hoop direction based on a careful interpretation of existing test data and observations. This model is simple, so it is suitable for direct use in design, but in the meantime, it captures all the main characteristics of the stress\u2013strain behavior of concrete confined by different types of FRP. In addition, for unconfined concrete, this model reduces directly to idealized stress\u2013strain curves in existing design codes. In the development of this model, a number of important issues including the actual hoop strains in FRP jackets at rupture, the sufficiency of FRP confinement for a significant strength enhancement, and the effect of jacket stiffness on the ultimate axial strain, were all carefully examined and appropriately resolved. The predictions of the model are shown to agree well with test data.",

Health as freedom from disease is then statistical normality of function, i.e., the ability to perform all typical physiological functions with at least typical efficiency. This conception of health is as value-free as statements of biological function. The view that health is essentially value-laden, held by most writers on the topic, seems to have one of two sources: an assumption that health judgments must be practical judgments about the treatment of patients, or a commitment to \u201cpositive\u201d health beyond the absence of disease.

Moreover, we estimate the spatial and temporal effects of land use change between 2001 and 2012 and the potential offset of the global application of conservation practices.

The greatest increases are predicted to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.

    "text":"Pollination and other ecosystem services produced by mobile organisms: a conceptual framework for the effects of land-use change. Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.",

Rather, the relative performance of invaders and co-occurring natives often depended on growing conditions. In 94% of 55 comparisons involving more than one growing condition, the native's performance was equal or superior to that of the invader, at least for some key performance measures in some growing conditions. Most commonly, these conditions involved reduced resources (nutrients, light, water) and\/or specific disturbance regimes. Independently of growing conditions, invaders were more likely to have higher leaf area and lower tissue construction costs (advantageous under high light and nutrient conditions) and greater phenotypic plasticity (particularly advantageous in disturbed environments where conditions are in frequent flux).

Most of the currently available nonviral gene vectors rely on two main components, cationic lipids and cationic polymers, and a variety of functional devices can be added to further optimize the systems. The design of these functional devices depends mainly on our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake and intracellular disposition of the therapeutic genes as well as their carriers. Macromolecules are internalized into cells by a variety of mechanisms, and their intracellular fate is usually linked to the entry mechanism.

Abstract An in-depth historical and current review is presented on the science of lithium-ion battery (LIB) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the graphite anode, including structure, morphology, composition, electrochemistry, and formation mechanism. During initial LIB operation, the SEI layer forms on the graphite surfaces, the most common anode material. The SEI is essential to the long-term performance of LIBs, and it also has an impact on its initial capacity loss, self-discharge characteristics, rate capability, and safety. While the presence of the anode SEI is vital, it is difficult to control its formation and growth, as they depend on several factors. These factors include the type of graphite, electrolyte composition, electrochemical conditions, and temperature. Thus, SEI formation and electrochemical stability over long-term operation should be a primary topic of future investigation in the LIB development. This article covers the progression of knowledge regarding the SEI, from its discovery in 1979 to the current state of understanding, and covers differences in the chemical and structural makeup when cell materials and components are varied.

It simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed, supplemental, deficit, and full irrigation conditions. The growth engine of AquaCrop is water-driven, in that transpiration is calculated first and translated into biomass using a conservative, crop-specific parameter: the biomass water productivity, normalized for atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO2 concentration. The normalization is to make AquaCrop applicable to diverse locations and seasons. Simulations are performed on thermal time, but can be on calendar time, in daily time-steps. The model uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index (LAI) as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration. Crop yield is calculated as the product of biomass and harvest index (HI). At the start of yield formation period, HI increases linearly with time after a lag phase, until near physiological maturity. Other than for the yield, there is no biomass partitioning into the various organs. Crop responses to water deficits are simulated with four modifiers that are functions of fractional available soil water modulated by evaporative demand, based on the differential sensitivity to water stress of four key plant processes: canopy expansion, stomatal control of transpiration, canopy senescence, and HI. The HI can be modified negatively or positively, depending on stress level, timing, and canopy duration. AquaCrop uses a relatively small number of parameters (explicit and mostly intuitive) and attempts to balance simplicity, accuracy, and robustness. The model is aimed mainly at practitioner-type end-users such as those working for extension services, consulting engineers, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and various kinds of farmers associations. It is also designed to fit the need of economists and policy specialists who use simple models for planning and scenario analysis.",

Abstract This paper demonstrates that US prestige-press coverage of global warming from 1988 to 2002 has contributed to a significant divergence of popular discourse from scientific discourse. This failed discursive translation results from an accumulation of tactical media responses and practices guided by widely accepted journalistic norms. Through content analysis of US prestige press\u2014meaning the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , and the Wall Street Journal \u2014this paper focuses on the norm of balanced reporting, and shows that the prestige press's adherence to balance actually leads to biased coverage of both anthropogenic contributions to global warming and resultant action.",

Neurofibrillary tangles advance from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC-II) toward limbic and association cortices as Alzheimer's disease evolves. However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.",

Wide-scale point-of-care diagnostic systems hold great promise for early detection of cancer at a curable stage of the disease.

Electrochemical biosensors have played an important significant role in the transition towards point-of-care diagnostic devices. Such electrical devices are extremely useful for delivering the diagnostic information in a fast, simple, and low cost fashion in connection to compact (hand-held) analyzers. Modern electrochemical bioaffinity sensors, such as DNA- or immunosensors, offer remarkable sensitivity essential for early cancer detection. The coupling of electrochemical devices with nanoscale materials offers a unique multiplexing capability for simultaneous measurements of multiple cancer markers. The attractive properties of electrochemical devices are extremely promising for improving the efficiency of cancer diagnostics and therapy monitoring. With further development and resources, such portable devices are expected to speed up the diagnosis of cancer, making analytical results available at patient bedside or physician office within few minutes.",

Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest known oxygen-evolving photosynthetic microorganisms, and they have had major impacts on shaping our current atmosphere and biosphere. Their long evolutionary history has enabled cyanobacteria to develop survival strategies and persist as important primary producers during numerous geochemical and climatic changes that have taken place on Earth during the past 3.5 billion years. Today, some cyanobacterial species form massive surface growths or \u2018blooms\u2019 that produce toxins, cause oxygen depletion and alter food webs, posing a major threat to drinking and irrigation water supplies, fishing and recreational use of surface waters worldwide. These harmful cyanobacteria can take advantage of anthropogenically induced nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), and hydrologic modifications (water withdrawal, reservoir construction). Here, we review recent studies revealing that regional and global climatic change may benefit various species of harmful cyanobacteria by increasing their growth rates, dominance, persistence, geographic distributions and activity. Future climatic change scenarios predict rising temperatures, enhanced vertical stratification of aquatic ecosystems, and alterations in seasonal and interannual weather patterns (including droughts, storms, floods); these changes all favour harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Therefore, current mitigation and water management strategies, which are largely based on nutrient input and hydrologic controls, must also accommodate the environmental effects of global warming.",

For centuries ecologists have studied how the diversity and functional traits of plant and animal communities vary across biomes. In contrast, we have only just begun exploring similar questions for soil microbial communities despite soil microbes being the dominant engines of biogeochemical cycles and a major pool of living biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. We used metagenomic sequencing to compare the composition and functional attributes of 16 soil microbial communities collected from cold deserts, hot deserts, forests, grasslands, and tundra. Those communities found in plant-free cold desert soils typically had the lowest levels of functional diversity (diversity of protein-coding gene categories) and the lowest levels of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity. Across all soils, functional beta diversity was strongly correlated with taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity; the desert microbial communities were clearly distinct from the nondesert communities regardless of the metric used. The desert communities had higher relative abundances of genes associated with osmoregulation and dormancy, but lower relative abundances of genes associated with nutrient cycling and the catabolism of plant-derived organic compounds. Antibiotic resistance genes were consistently threefold less abundant in the desert soils than in the nondesert soils, suggesting that abiotic conditions, not competitive interactions, are more important in shaping the desert microbial communities. As the most comprehensive survey of soil taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to date, this study demonstrates that metagenomic approaches can be used to build a predictive understanding of how microbial diversity and function vary across terrestrial biomes.",

In this study, a modified high-volume sampling method (PS-1 sampler) was employed to collect airborne PAHs in both the particulate and gas phases. Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatographs equipped with the flame ionization and mass spectrometer detectors (GC\/FID and GC\/MS) were used to analyze the samples. The sources sampled were: coke ovens, highway vehicles, heavy-duty diesel engines, gasoline engines and wood combustion. Results of this study showed that two and three ring PAHs were responsible for 98, 76, 92, 73 and 80% of the total concentration of measured 20 PAHs for coke ovens, diesel engines, highway tunnels, gasoline engines and wood combustion samples, respectively. Six ring PAHs such as indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi)perylene were mostly below the detection limit of this study and only detected in the highway tunnel, diesel and gasoline engine samples.

The rapid rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded the extraction of hydrocarbon resources in the U.S. The rise of shale gas development has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects from hydraulic fracturing. This paper provides a critical review of the potential risks that shale gas operations pose to water resources, with an emphasis on case studies mostly from the U.S. Four potential risks for water resources are identified: (1) the contamination of shallow aquifers with fugitive hydrocarbon gases (i.e., stray gas contamination), which can also potentially lead to the salinization of shallow groundwater through leaking natural gas wells and subsurface flow; (2) the contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and\/or the disposal of inadequately treated shale gas wastewater; (3) the accumulation of toxic and radioactive elements in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) the overextraction of water resources for high-volume hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages or conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. Analysis of published data (through January 2014) reveals evidence for stray gas contamination, surface water impacts in areas of intensive shale gas development, and the accumulation of radium isotopes in some disposal and spill sites. The direct contamination of shallow groundwater from hydraulic fracturing fluids and deep formation waters by hydraulic fracturing itself, however, remains controversial.",

    "text":"The Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN): a high resolution global model to estimate the emissions from open burning. Abstract. The Fire INventory from NCAR version 1.0 (FINNv1) provides daily, 1 km resolution, global estimates of the trace gas and particle emissions from open burning of biomass, which includes wildfire, agricultural fires, and prescribed burning and does not include biofuel use and trash burning. Emission factors used in the calculations have been updated with recent data, particularly for the non-methane organic compounds (NMOC). The resulting global annual NMOC emission estimates are as much as a factor of 5 greater than some prior estimates. Chemical speciation profiles, necessary to allocate the total NMOC emission estimates to lumped species for use by chemical transport models, are provided for three widely used chemical mechanisms: SAPRC99, GEOS-CHEM, and MOZART-4. Using these profiles, FINNv1 also provides global estimates of key organic compounds, including formaldehyde and methanol. Uncertainties in the emissions estimates arise from several of the method steps. The use of fire hot spots, assumed area burned, land cover maps, biomass consumption estimates, and emission factors all introduce error into the model estimates. The uncertainty in the FINNv1 emission estimates are about a factor of two; but, the global estimates agree reasonably well with other global inventories of biomass burning emissions for CO, CO2, and other species with less variable emission factors. FINNv1 emission estimates have been developed specifically for modeling atmospheric chemistry and air quality in a consistent framework at scales from local to global. The product is unique because of the high temporal and spatial resolution, global coverage, and the number of species estimated. FINNv1 can be used for both hindcast and forecast or near-real time model applications and the results are being critically evaluated with models and observations whenever possible.",

The National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (NRCPR) is an American Heart Association (AHA)-sponsored, prospective, multisite, observational study of in-hospital resuscitation. The NRCPR is currently the largest registry of its kind. The purpose of this article is to describe the NRCPR and to provide the first comprehensive, Utstein-based, standardized characterization of in-hospital resuscitation in the United States. All adult (\u226518 years of age) and pediatric (<18 years of age) patients, visitors, employees, and staff within a facility (including ambulatory care areas) who experience a resuscitation event are eligible for inclusion in the NRCPR database. Between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2002, 14 720 cardiac arrests that met inclusion criteria occurred in adults at the 207 participating hospitals. An organized emergency team is available 24 h a day, 7 days a week in 86% of participating institutions. The three most common reasons for cardiac arrest in adults were (1) cardiac arrhythmia, (2) acute respiratory insufficiency, and (3) hypotension. Overall, 44% of adult in-hospital cardiac arrest victims had a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); 17% survived to hospital discharge. Despite the fact that a primary arrhythmia was one of the precipitating events in nearly one half of adult cardiac arrests, ventricular fibrillation (VF) was the initial pulseless rhythm in only 16% of in-hospital cardiac arrest victims. ROSC occurred in 58% of VF cases, yielding a survival-to-hospital discharge rate of 34% in this subset of patients. An automated external defibrillator was used to provide initial defibrillation in only 1.4% of patients whose initial cardiac arrest rhythm was VF. Neurological outcome in discharged survivors was generally good. Eighty-six percent of patients with Cerebral Performance Category-1 (CPC-1) at the time of hospital admission had a postarrest CPC-1 at the time of hospital discharge.",

    "text":"Detecting trends in forest disturbance and recovery using yearly Landsat time series: 1. LandTrendr \u2014 Temporal segmentation algorithms. Abstract We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Landsat archive.",

    "text":"A review on the generation, determination and mitigation of Urban Heat Island. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment.",

Background The interrogation of proteomes (\u201cproteomics\u201d) in a highly multiplexed and efficient manner remains a coveted and challenging goal in biology and medicine. Methodology\/Principal Findings We present a new aptamer-based proteomic technology for biomarker discovery capable of simultaneously measuring thousands of proteins from small sample volumes (15 \u00b5L of serum or plasma). Our current assay measures 813 proteins with low limits of detection (1 pM median), 7 logs of overall dynamic range (\u223c100 fM\u20131 \u00b5M), and 5% median coefficient of variation. This technology is enabled by a new generation of aptamers that contain chemically modified nucleotides, which greatly expand the physicochemical diversity of the large randomized nucleic acid libraries from which the aptamers are selected. Proteins in complex matrices such as plasma are measured with a process that transforms a signature of protein concentrations into a corresponding signature of DNA aptamer concentrations, which is quantified on a DNA microarray. Our assay takes advantage of the dual nature of aptamers as both folded protein-binding entities with defined shapes and unique nucleotide sequences recognizable by specific hybridization probes. To demonstrate the utility of our proteomics biomarker discovery technology, we applied it to a clinical study of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified two well known CKD biomarkers as well as an additional 58 potential CKD biomarkers. These results demonstrate the potential utility of our technology to rapidly discover unique protein signatures characteristic of various disease states. Conclusions\/Significance We describe a versatile and powerful tool that allows large-scale comparison of proteome profiles among discrete populations. This unbiased and highly multiplexed search engine will enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in a manner that is unencumbered by our incomplete knowledge of biology, thereby helping to advance the next generation of evidence-based medicine.",

    "text":"Overview of current and future energy storage technologies for electric power applications. In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken.",

The Georgia Institute of Technology\u2010Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model is used to simulate the aerosol optical thickness t for major types of tropospheric aerosols including sulfate, dust, organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), and sea salt. The GOCART model uses a dust emission algorithm that quantifies the dust source as a function of the degree of topographic depression, and a biomass burning emission source that includes seasonal and interannual variability based on satellite observations. Results presented here show that on global average, dust aerosol has the highest t at 500 nm (0.051), followed by sulfate (0.040), sea salt (0.027), OC (0.017), and BC (0.007). There are large geographical and seasonal variations of t, controlled mainly by emission, transport, and hygroscopic properties of aerosols. The model calculated total ts at 500 nm have been compared with the satellite retrieval products from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) over both land and ocean and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over the ocean. The model reproduces most of the prominent features in the satellite data, with an overall agreement within a factor of 2 over the aerosol source areas and outflow regions. While there are clear differences among the satellite products, a major discrepancy between the model and the satellite data is that the model shows a stronger variation of t from source to remote regions. Quantitative comparison of model and satellite data is still difficult, due to the large uncertainties involved in deriving the t values by both the model and satellite retrieval, and by the inconsistency in physical and optical parameters used between the model and the satellite retrieval. The comparison of monthly averaged model results with the sun photometer network [Aerosol Robotics Network (AERONET)] measurements shows that the model reproduces the seasonal variations at most of the sites, especially the places where biomass burning or dust aerosol dominates.",

While technological progress has fostered the conception of an urban society that is increasingly decoupled from ecosystems, demands on natural capital and ecosystem services keep increasing steadily in our urbanized planet. Decoupling of cities from ecological systems can only occur locally and partially, thanks to the appropriation of vast areas of ecosystem services provision beyond the city boundaries. Conserving and restoring ecosystem services in urban areas can reduce the ecological footprints and the ecological debts of cities while enhancing resilience, health, and quality of life for their inhabitants. In this paper we synthesize knowledge and methods to classify and value ecosystem services for urban planning. First, we categorize important ecosystem services and disservices in urban areas. Second, we describe valuation languages (economic costs, socio\u2010cultural values, resilience) that capture distinct value dimensions of urban ecosystem services. Third, we identify analytical challenges for valuation to inform urban planning in the face of high heterogeneity and fragmentation characterizing urban ecosystems. The paper discusses various ways through which urban ecosystems services can enhance resilience and quality of life in cities and identifies a range of economic costs and socio\u2010cultural impacts that can derive from their loss.

Abstract The reactive force-field (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.",

Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area.

It characterizes the canopy-atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most difficult to quantify properly, owing to large spatial and temporal variability. Many methods have been developed to quantify LAI from the ground and some of them are also suitable for describing other structural parameters of the canopy. This paper reviews the direct and indirect methods, the required instruments, their advantages, disadvantages and accuracy of the results. Analysis of the literature shows that most cross-validations between direct and indirect methods have pointed to a significant underestimation of LAI with the latter techniques, especially in forest stands.

Two simple self-report measures have been used to assess the heaviness of smoking, 'number of cigarettes per day' (CPD) and 'time to the first cigarette of the day' (TTF). Little attention, however, has been given to the precise method of scoring this information. Using biochemical indicators of heaviness of smoking (alveolar carbon monoxide and cotinine), we explore the optimum data transformations for regression analysis and categorical analysis. We suggest a four category scoring scheme for both time to the first cigarette of the day (less than or equal to 5, 6-30, 31-60 and 61+ min) and average daily consumption of cigarettes (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31+ cigarettes) as the most powerful and practical categorical scoring of these variables. Due to possible ceiling effects on biochemical measures, we suggest using logarithmic transformations of CPD or TTF for regression or correlation analyses.",

    "text":"Avoiding horror autotoxicus: The importance of dendritic cells in peripheral T cell tolerance. The immune system generally avoids horror autotoxicus or autoimmunity, an attack against the body's own constituents. This avoidance requires that self-reactive T cells be actively silenced or tolerized. We propose that dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in establishing tolerance, especially in the periphery, after functioning T cells have been produced in the thymus. In the steady state, meaning in the absence of acute infection and inflammation, DCs are in an immature state and not fully differentiated to carry out their known roles as inducers of immunity. Nevertheless, immature DCs continuously circulate through tissues and into lymphoid organs, capturing self antigens as well as innocuous environmental proteins. Recent experiments have provided direct evidence that antigen-loaded immature DCs silence T cells either by deleting them or by expanding regulatory T cells. This capacity of DCs to induce peripheral tolerance can work in two opposing ways in the context of infection. In acute infection, a beneficial effect should occur. The immune system would overcome the risk of developing autoimmunity and chronic inflammation if, before infection, tolerance were induced to innocuous environmental proteins as well as self antigens captured from dying infected cells. For chronic or persistent pathogens, a second but dire potential could take place. Continuous presentation of a pathogen by immature DCs, HIV-1 for example, may lead to tolerance and active evasion of protective immunity. The function of DCs in defining immunologic self provides a new focus for the study of autoimmunity and chronic immune-based diseases.",

    "text":"Validation of Accelerometer Wear and Nonwear Time Classification Algorithm. Introduction: The use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity (PA) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for the validation of subjective PA self-reports. A vital step in PA measurement is the classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter. Methods: We conducted a validation study of a wear or nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target. Results: The recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the upstream or downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P values < 0.001). Conclusions: The accelerometer wear or nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.",

This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast \u2018climate analogue model\u2019, based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494\u00a0Pg\u00a0C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels.",

Aim At a coarse scale, the treelines of the world's mountains seem to follow a common isotherm, but the evidence for this has been indirect so far. Here we aim at underpinning this with facts. Location We present the results of a data-logging campaign at 46 treeline sites between 68\u00b0 N and 42\u00b0 S. Methods We measured root-zone temperatures with an hourly resolution over 1\u20133 years per site between 1996 and 2003. Results Disregarding taxon-, landuse- or fire-driven tree limits, high altitude climatic treelines are associated with a seasonal mean ground temperature of 6.7 \u00b0C (\u00b10.8 SD; 2.2 K amplitude of means for different climatic zones), a surprisingly narrow range. Temperatures are higher (7\u20138 \u00b0C) in the temperate and Mediterranean zone treelines, and are lower in equatorial treelines (5\u20136 \u00b0C) and in the subarctic and boreal zone (6\u20137 \u00b0C). While air temperatures are higher than soil temperatures in warm periods, and are lower than soil temperatures in cold periods, daily means of air and soil temperature are almost the same at 6\u20137 \u00b0C, a physics driven coincidence with the global mean temperature at treeline. The length of the growing season, thermal extremes or thermal sums have no predictive value for treeline altitude on a global scale. Some Mediterranean (Fagus spp.) and temperate South Hemisphere treelines (Nothofagus spp.) and the native treeline in Hawaii (Metrosideros) are located at substantially higher isotherms and represent genus-specific boundaries rather than boundaries of the life-form tree. In seasonal climates, ground temperatures in winter (absolute minima) reflect local snow pack and seem uncritical. Main conclusions The data support the hypothesis of a common thermal threshold for forest growth at high elevation, but also reflect a moderate region and substantial taxonomic influence.",

Mitochondrial DNA stress potentiates type I interferon responses via activation of the cGAS\u2013STING\u2013IRF3 pathway. Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria, the organelles primarily responsible for cellular respiration and energy production, are also critical centres for antibacterial and antiviral innate immune responses. This study describes a link between mitochondrial stress and antiviral innate immunity. Specifically, mitochondrial DNA stress in herpes virus infected mice is shown to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance through activation of the DNA sensor cGAS and the STING\u2013IRF3 stress pathway. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally present at thousands of copies per cell and is packaged into several hundred higher-order structures termed nucleoids1. The abundant mtDNA-binding protein TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation2. Complete mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses3. However, the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined4. Here we show that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as TMEM173)\u2013IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic trigger of antiviral signalling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage antiviral innate immunity.",

Soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic devices provide a novel platform to interface with soft tissues for robotic feedback and control, regenerative medicine, and continuous health monitoring. Here, we introduce the term \"lab-on-skin\" to describe a set of electronic devices that have physical properties, such as thickness, thermal mass, elastic modulus, and water-vapor permeability, which resemble those of the skin.

Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics.

Studies into the effects of ultrafine particles in the lung have shown adverse effects considered to be due in part to the particle size. Air pollution particles (PM(10)) are associated with exacerbations of respiratory disease and deaths from cardiovascular causes in epidemiological studies and the ultrafine fraction of PM(10) has been hypothesized to play an important role. The aim of the present study was to investigate proinflammatory responses to various sizes of polystyrene particles as a simple model of particles of varying size including ultrafine. In the animal model, we demonstrated that there was a significantly greater neutrophil influx into the rat lung after instillation of 64-nm polystyrene particles compared with 202- and 535-nm particles and this was mirrored in other parameters of lung inflammation, such as increased protein and lactate dehydrogenase in bronchoalveolar lavage. When surface area instilled was plotted against inflammation, these two variables were directly proportional and the line passed through zero. This suggests that surface area drives inflammation in the short term and that ultrafine particles cause a greater inflammatory response because of the greater surface area they possess. In vitro, we measured the changes in intracellular calcium concentration in mono mac 6 cells in view of the potential role of calcium as a signaling molecule. Calcium changes after particle exposure may be important in leading to proinflammatory gene expression such as chemokines. We demonstrated that only ultrafine polystyrene particles induced a significant increase in cytosolic calcium ion concentration. Experiments using dichlorofluorescin diacetate demonstrated greater oxidant activity of the ultrafine particles, which may explain their activity in these assays. There were significant increases in IL-8 gene expression in A549 epithelial cells after treatment with the ultrafine particles but not particles of other sizes. These findings suggest that ultrafine particles composed of low-toxicity material such as polystyrene have proinflammatory activity as a consequence of their large surface area. This supports a role for such particles in the adverse health effects of PM(10).",

We begin by discussing patterns in microbial biogeography and then describe four basic processes (diversification, dispersal, selection, and drift) that contribute to community assembly. We also discuss different combinations of these processes and where and when they may be most important for shaping microbial communities. The spatial and temporal scales of microbial community assembly are also discussed in relation to assembly processes. Throughout this review paper, we highlight differences between microbes and macroorganisms and generate hypotheses describing how these differences may be important for community assembly.

Control of H2O2 levels is complex and dissection of mechanisms generating and relieving H2O2 stress is difficult, particularly in intact plants. We have used transgenic tobacco with approximately 10% wild-type catalase activity to study the role of catalase and effects of H2O2 stress in plants. Catalase-deficient plants showed no visible disorders at low light, but in elevated light rapidly developed white necrotic lesions on the leaves. Lesion formation required photorespiratory activity since damage was prevented under elevated CO2. Accumulation of H2O2 was not detected during leaf necrosis. Alternative H2O2-scavenging mechanisms may have compensated for reduced catalase activity, as shown by increased ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase levels. Leaf necrosis correlated with accumulation of oxidized glutathione and a 4-fold decrease in ascorbate, indicating that catalase is critical for maintaining the redox balance during oxidative stress. Such control may not be limited to peroxisomal H2O2 production. Catalase functions as a cellular sink for H2O2, as evidenced by complementation of catalase deficiency by exogenous catalase, and comparison of catalase-deficient and control leaf discs in removing external H2O2. Stress analysis revealed increased susceptibility of catalase-deficient plants to paraquat, salt and ozone, but not to chilling.",

Mechanisms to mitigate global climate change by sequestering carbon (C) in different \u2018sinks' have been proposed as at least temporary measures. Of the major global C pools, terrestrial ecosystems hold the potential to capture and store substantially increased volumes of C in soil organic matter (SOM) through changes in management that are also of benefit to the multitude of ecosystem services that soils provide. This potential can only be realized by determining the amount of SOM stored in soils now, with subsequent quantification of how this is affected by management strategies intended to increase SOM concentrations, and used in soil C models for the prediction of the roles of soils in future climate change. An apparently obvious method to increase C stocks in soils is to augment the soil C pools with the longest mean residence times (MRT). Computer simulation models of soil C dynamics, e.g. RothC and Century, partition these refractory constituents into slow and passive pools with MRTs of centuries to millennia. This partitioning is assumed to reflect: (i) the average biomolecular properties of SOM in the pools with reference to their source in plant litter, (ii) the accessibility of the SOM to decomposer organisms or catalytic enzymes, or (iii) constraints imposed on decomposition by environmental conditions, including soil moisture and temperature. However, contemporary analytical approaches suggest that the chemical composition of these pools is not necessarily predictable because, despite considerable progress with understanding decomposition processes and the role of decomposer organisms, along with refinements in simulation models, little progress has been made in reconciling biochemical properties with the kinetically defined pools. In this review, we will explore how advances in quantitative analytical techniques have redefined the new understanding of SOM dynamics and how this is affecting the development and application of new modelling approaches to soil C.",

The purpose of this article is to provide awareness of the nature and variability in pore structures within gas shales and not to provide a representative evaluation on the previously mentioned North American reservoirs. To understand the pore system of these rocks, the total porosity, pore-size distribution, surface area, organic geochemistry, mineralogy, and image analyses by electron microscopy were performed. Total porosity from helium pycnometry ranges between 2.5 and 6.6%. Total organic carbon content ranges between 0.7 and 6.8 wt. %, and vitrinite reflectance measured between 1.45 and 2.37%. The gas shales in the United States are clay and quartz rich, with the Doig Formation samples being quartz and carbonate rich and clay poor. Higher porosity samples have higher values because of a greater abundance of mesopores compared with lower porosity samples. With decreasing total porosity, micropore volumes relatively increase whereas the sum of mesopores and macropore volumes decrease. Focused ion beam milling, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy provide high-resolution (\u223c5 nm) images of pore distribution and geometries. Image analysis provides a visual appreciation of pore systems in gas shale reservoirs but is not a statistically valid method to evaluate gas shale reservoirs.

Question: A set of easily-measured (\u2018soft\u2019) plant traits has been identified as potentially useful predictors of ecosystem functioning in previous studies. Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with \u2018harder\u2019 traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location: central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of \u2018soft\u2019 traits and \u2018hard\u2019 traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors (\u2018hard\u2019 traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.",

Then a template is provided for better reporting of LCOE results for PV needed to influence policy mandates or make invest decisions. A numerical example is provided with variable ranges to test sensitivity, allowing for conclusions to be drawn on the most important variables. Grid parity is considered when the LCOE of solar PV is comparable with grid electrical prices of conventional technologies and is the industry target for cost-effectiveness. Given the state of the art in the technology and favorable financing terms it is clear that PV has already obtained grid parity in specific locations and as installed costs continue to decline, grid electricity prices continue to escalate, and industry experience increases, PV will become an increasingly economically advantageous source of electricity over expanding geographical regions.",

    "text":"Airborne Particulate Matter and Human Health: Toxicological Assessment and Importance of Size and Composition of Particles for Oxidative Damage and Carcinogenic Mechanisms. Air pollution has been considered a hazard to human health. In the past decades, many studies highlighted the role of ambient airborne particulate matter (PM) as an important environmental pollutant for many different cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer. Numerous epidemiological studies in the past 30 years found a strong exposure-response relationship between PM for short-term effects (premature mortality, hospital admissions) and long-term or cumulative health effects (morbidity, lung cancer, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary diseases, etc). Current research on airborne particle-induced health effects investigates the critical characteristics of particulate matter that determine their biological effects. Several independent groups of investigators have shown that the size of the airborne particles and their surface area determine the potential to elicit inflammatory injury, oxidative damage, and other biological effects. These effects are stronger for fine and ultrafine particles because they can penetrate deeper into the airways of the respiratory tract and can reach the alveoli in which 50% are retained in the lung parenchyma. Composition of the PM varies greatly and depends on many factors. The major components of PM are transition metals, ions (sulfate, nitrate), organic compound, quinoid stable radicals of carbonaceous material, minerals, reactive gases, and materials of biologic origin. Results from toxicological research have shown that PM have several mechanisms of adverse cellular effects, such as cytotoxicity through oxidative stress mechanisms, oxygen-free radical-generating activity, DNA oxidative damage, mutagenicity, and stimulation of proinflammatory factors. In this review, the results of the most recent epidemiological and toxicological studies are summarized. In general, the evaluation of most of these studies shows that the smaller the size of PM the higher the toxicity through mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation. Some studies showed that the extractable organic compounds (a variety of chemicals with mutagenic and cytotoxic properties) contribute to various mechanisms of cytotoxicity; in addition, the water-soluble faction (mainly transition metals with redox potential) play an important role in the initiation of oxidative DNA damage and membrane lipid peroxidation. Associations between chemical compositions and particle toxicity tend to be stronger for the fine and ultrafine PM size fractions. Vehicular exhaust particles are found to be most responsible for small-sized airborne PM air pollution in urban areas. With these aspects in mind, future research should aim at establishing a cleared picture of the cytotoxic and carcinogenic mechanisms of PM in the lungs, as well as mechanisms of formation during internal engine combustion processes and other sources of airborne fine particles of air pollution.",

In Ras-expressing cells, defective autophagosome formation or cargo delivery causes accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and reduced oxygen consumption. Autophagy defects also lead to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolite and energy depletion in starvation. As mitochondria sustain viability of Ras-expressing cells in starvation, autophagy is required to maintain the pool of functional mitochondria necessary to support growth of Ras-driven tumors.

The response of soil organic matter (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality )o r its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption\/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.",

Current methods to improve the engineering properties of sands are diverse with respect to methodology, treatment uniformity, cost, environmental impact, site accessibility requirements, etc. All of these methods have benefits and drawbacks, and there continues to be a need to explore new possibilities of soil improvement, particularly as suitable land for development becomes more scarce. This paper presents the results of a study in which natural microbial biological processes were used to engineer a cemented soil matrix within initially loose, collapsible sand. Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) was achieved using the microorganism Bacillus pasteurii, an aerobic bacterium pervasive in natural soil deposits. The microbes were introduced to the sand specimens in a liquid growth medium amended with urea and a dissolved calcium source. Subsequent cementation treatments were passed through the specimen to increase the cementation level of the sand particle matrix. The results of both MICP- and gypsum-cemented specimens were assessed nondestructively by measuring the shear wave velocity with bender elements. A series of isotropically consolidated undrained compression (CIUC) triaxial tests indicate that the MICP-treated specimens exhibit a noncollapse strain softening shear behavior, with a higher initial shear stiffness and ultimate shear capacity than untreated loose specimens. This behavior is similar to that of the gypsum-cemented specimens, which represent typical cemented sand behavior. SEM microscopy verified formation of a cemented sand matrix with a concentration of precipitated calcite forming bonds at particle-particle contacts. X-ray compositional mapping confirmed that the observed cement bonds were comprised of calcite.",

Evolutionary hypotheses about how so many species of tropical rainforest trees might have arisen include (a) genetic drift (71), (b) habitat specialization (8) in benign environments, or (c) repeated geographic isolation followed by remixing of species during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations (144). Ecological hypotheses about how these species continue to coexist are often cast into equilibrium or non-equilibrium frameworks: Do tropical forests comprise  . . . sets of highly coevolved niche-differentiated tree species in stable or semistable floristic assemblages, or do they consist of  . . . diffusely coevolved, broadly generalist species which slowly drift in relative abundance within a few large life-history guilds (67, 102)? In this context, there has been considerable recent interest in the role of adaptations by species to different regeneration sites in structuring plant assemblages in general (83, 84, 86, 141), and tropical tree communities in particular (62, 89, 90, 150). The immediacy of this interest is heightened by rising rates of deforestation throughout the tropics and a critical need for management strategies of the remaining preserves, for ecologically sound harvesting procedures, and for the tools with which to restore degraded forests. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees (5, 33, 62, 90).

First, the rigid body modes are eliminated in parallel from each local problem and a direct scheme is applied concurrently to all subdomains in order to recover each partial local solution. Next, the contributions of these modes are related to the Lagrange multipliers through an orthogonality condition. A parallel conjugate projected gradient algorithm is developed for the solution of the coupled system of local rigid modes components and Lagrange multipliers, which completes the solution of the problem. When implemented on local memory multiprocessors, this proposed method of tearing and interconnecting requires less interprocessor communications than the classical method of substructuring.

It images matter with electrons that scatter strongly from individual atoms and whose wavelengths are about 50 times smaller than an atom. Recently the technique has advanced greatly owing to the introduction of aberration-corrected optics. However, neither electron microscopy nor any other experimental technique has yet been able to resolve and identify all the atoms in a non-periodic material consisting of several atomic species.

Previous reviews have examined root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\r\n\r\nThis study reviewed root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. A key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. Of the 786 root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratio observations collated, 62% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. When only the reliable data were examined, root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height.\r\n\r\nAlthough a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetation-specific root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. When the root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. The use of the vegetation-specific root\u00a0:\u00a0shoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.",

Reconsidering niches in transitions to sustainability. \u25ba The concept of protection has not been systematically interrogated in sustainability transitions. \u25ba Our analysis identifies three properties of protection: shielding, nurturing and empowerment. \u25ba Empowerment is the least developed; a distinction is made between fit-and-confirm and stretch-and-transform empowerment. \u25ba It is proposed to analyse the politics involved in empowerment with the notion of narratives. \u25ba Future research is proposed to focus on the empirical reconstruction of niche development in light of the present framework and the analyses of the diverse political narratives across time and space. The transitions literature emphasises the role of niches, defined as a protective space for path-breaking innovations. Surprisingly, the concept of protection has not been systematically interrogated. Our analysis identifies effective protection as having three properties in wider transition processes: shielding, nurturing and empowerment. Empowerment is considered the least developed in current niche literature. It can be understood as either processes that make niche innovations competitive within unchanged selection environments (fit-and-conform) or as processes that contribute to changes in mainstream selection environments in ways favourable to a path-breaking niche innovation (stretch-and-transform). Adopting a more constructivist perspective, we subsequently argue that analysis of these properties needs to be complemented with particular attention for the politics involved in their construction. Attention to empowerment confirms the view that niche actors need to link to wider processes of social change, and suggests how this arises. The paper ends with an outlook upon two promising research avenues: (1) the reconstruction of niche development in light of the present framework; (2) analyses of the diverse (political) narratives seeking to empower niches across time and space.",

    "text":"Nucleosynthesis in Chandrasekhar Mass Models for Type Ia Supernovae and Constraints on Progenitor Systems and Burning\u2010Front Propagation. The major uncertainties involved in the Chandrasekhar mass models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are related to the companion star of their accreting white dwarf progenitor (which determines the accretion rate and consequently the carbon ignition density) and the flame speed after the carbon ignition. We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in relatively slow deflagrations with a variety of deflagration speeds and ignition densities to put new constraints on the above key quantities. The abundance of the Fe group, in particular of neutron-rich species like 48Ca,50Ti,54Cr,54,58Fe, and 58Ni, is highly sensitive to the electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields obtained from such a slow central deflagration, and from a fast deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. To avoid excessively large ratios of 54Cr\/56Fe and 50Ti\/56Fe, the central density of the average white dwarf progenitor at ignition should be as low as 2 ? 109 g cm-3. To avoid the overproduction of 58Ni and 54Fe, either the flame speed should not exceed a few percent of the sound speed in the central low Ye layers or the metallicity of the average progenitors has to be lower than solar. Such low central densities can be realized by a rapid accretion as fast as -->img1.gif 1 ? 10-7 M? yr-1. In order to reproduce the solar abundance of 48Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that undergo ignition at higher densities. Even the smallest laminar flame speeds after the low-density ignitions would not produce sufficient amount of this isotope. We also found that the total amount of 56Ni, the Si-Ca\/Fe ratio, and the abundance of some elements like Mn and Cr (originating from incomplete Si burning), depend on the density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed detonations. Our nucleosynthesis results favor transition densities slightly below 2.2 ? 107 g cm-3.",

Modern computers are based on the von Neumann architecture in which computation and storage are physically separated: data are fetched from the memory unit, shuttled to the processing unit (where computation takes place) and then shuttled back to the memory unit to be stored. The rate at which data can be transferred between the processing unit and the memory unit represents a fundamental limitation of modern computers, known as the memory wall. In-memory computing is an approach that attempts to address this issue by designing systems that compute within the memory, thus eliminating the energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement that plagues current designs. Here we review the development of in-memory computing using resistive switching devices, where the two-terminal structure of the devices, their resistive switching properties, and direct data processing in the memory can enable area- and energy-efficient computation. We examine the different digital, analogue, and stochastic computing schemes that have been proposed, and explore the microscopic physical mechanisms involved. Finally, we discuss the challenges in-memory computing faces, including the required scaling characteristics, in delivering next-generation computing.

Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises, whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multimodel ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience (i) high magnitudes of local climate change, (ii) development of novel 21st-century climates, and\/or (iii) the disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39% and 10-48% of the Earth's terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20% and 4-20%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates.

We established the turnover rates of 13C in tissues of grown Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) by switching the diet of an experimental group from a wheat-based (C3) diet to a corn-based (C4) diet and sampled tissues periodically for 212 days. An exponential model described patterns of isotopic turnover in all tissues. Turnover rates for quail tissues were ranked liver > blood > muscle > bone collagen with the half life of carbon ranging from 2.6 days in liver to 173.3 days in bone collagen. A similar diet-switch experiment was conducted on captive American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and feather samples were assayed isotopically. Stable isotope values of crow feathers reflected diet during periods of growth.

Abstract New, exciting opportunities for utilizing biological processes to modify the engineering properties of the subsurface (e.g. strength, stiffness, permeability) have recently emerged. Enabled by interdisciplinary research at the confluence of microbiology, geochemistry, and civil engineering, this new field has the potential to meet society's ever-expanding needs for innovative treatment processes that improve soil supporting new and existing infrastructure. This paper first presents an overview of bio-mediated improvement systems, identifying the primary components and interplay between different disciplines. Geometric compatibility between soil and microbes that restricts the utility of different systems is identified. Focus is then narrowed to a specific system, namely bio-mediated calcite precipitation of sands. Following an overview of the process, alternative biological processes for inducing calcite precipitation are identified and various microscopy techniques are used to assess how the pore space volume is altered by calcite precipitation, the calcite precipitation is distributed spatially within the pore space, and the precipitated calcite degrades during loading. Non-destructive geophysical process monitoring techniques are described and their utility explored. Next, the extent to which various soil engineering properties is identified through experimental examples. Potential advantages and envisioned applications of bio-mediated soil improvement are identified.

Ultrasound can enhance existing extraction processes and enable new commercial extraction opportunities and processes. New UAE processing approaches have been proposed, including, (a) the potential for modification of plant cell material to provide improved bioavailability of micro-nutrients while retaining the natural-like quality, (b) simultaneous extraction and encapsulation, (c) quenching of the radical sonochemistry especially in aqueous systems to avoid degradation of bioactives and (d) potential use of the radical sonochemistry to achieve targeted hydroxylation of polyphenolics and carotenoids to increase bioactivity.

In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund\u2013Potsdam\u2013Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO2 fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and\/or irrigated, within 0.5\u00b0 grid cells for the period 1901\u20132000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a \u223c24% (respectively \u223c10%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6\u20139 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO2) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are\u223c5% (respectively\u223c20%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and\u223c44% increase in evaporation.

Abstract The atmospheric CO 2 concentration is increasing, due primarily to fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Sequestering atmospheric C in agricultural soils is being advocated as a possibility to partially offset fossil-fuel emissions. Sequestering C in agriculture requires a change in management practices, i.e. efficient use of pesticides, irrigation, and farm machinery. The C emissions associated with a change in practices have not traditionally been incorporated comprehensively into C sequestration analyses. A full C cycle analysis has been completed for agricultural inputs, resulting in estimates of net C flux for three crop types across three tillage intensities. The full C cycle analysis includes estimates of energy use and C emissions for primary fuels, electricity, fertilizers, lime, pesticides, irrigation, seed production, and farm machinery. Total C emissions values were used in conjunction with C sequestration estimates to model net C flux to the atmosphere over time. Based on US average crop inputs, no-till emitted less CO 2 from agricultural operations than did conventional tillage, with 137 and 168\u00a0kg\u00a0C\u00a0ha \u22121 per year, respectively. Changing from conventional tillage to no-till is therefore estimated to both enhance C sequestration and decrease CO 2 emissions. While the enhanced C sequestration will continue for a finite time, the reduction in net CO 2 flux to the atmosphere, caused by the reduced fossil-fuel use, can continue indefinitely, as long as the alternative practice is continued. Estimates of net C flux, which are based on US average inputs, will vary across crop type and different climate regimes. The C coefficients calculated for agricultural inputs can be used to estimate C emissions and net C flux on a site-specific basis.",

Plant traits regulate net soil carbon storage by controlling carbon assimilation, its transfer and storage in belowground biomass, and its release from soil through respiration, fire and leaching. However, our mechanistic understanding of these processes is incomplete. Here, we present a mechanistic framework, based on the plant traits that drive soil carbon inputs and outputs, for understanding how alteration of vegetation composition will affect soil carbon sequestration under global changes. First, we show direct and indirect plant trait effects on soil carbon input and output through autotrophs and heterotrophs, and through modification of abiotic conditions, which need to be considered to determine the local carbon sequestration potential. Second, we explore how the composition of key plant traits and soil biota related to carbon input, release and storage prevail in different biomes across the globe, and address the biome-specific mechanisms by which plant trait composition may impact on soil carbon sequestration. We propose that a trait-based approach will help to develop strategies to preserve and promote carbon sequestration.",

    "text":"Radiological Use of Fast Protons. Except for electrons, the particles which have been accelerated to high energies by machines such as cyclotrons or Van de Graaff generators have not been directly used therapeutically. Rather, the neutrons, gamma rays, or artificial radioactivities produced in various reactions of the primary particles have been applied to medical problems. This has, in large part, been due to the very short penetration in tissue of protons, deuterons, and alpha particles from present accelerators. Higher-energy machines are now under construction, however, and the ions from them will in general be energetic enough to have a range in tissue comparable to body dimensions. It must have occurred to many people that the particles themselves now become of considerable therapeutic interest. The object of this paper is to acquaint medical and biological workers with some of the physical properties and possibilities of such rays. To be as simple as possible, let us consider only high-energy protons: later we can generalize to other particles. The accelerators now being constructed or planned will yield protons of energies above 125 Mev (million electron volts) and perhaps as high as 400 Met. The range of a 125 Met proton in tissue is 12 cm., while that of a 200 Met proton is 27 cm. It is clear that such protons can penetrate to any part of the body. The proton proceeds through the tissue in very nearly a straight line, and the tissue is ionized at the expense of the energy of the proton until the proton is stopped. The dosage is proportional to the ionization per centimeter of path, or specific ionization, and this varies almost inversely with the energy of the proton. Thus the specific ionization or dose is many times less where the proton enters the tissue at high energy than it is in the last centimeter of the path where the ion is brought to rest. These properties make it possible to irradiate intensely a strictly localized region within the body, with but little skin dose. It will be easy to produce well collimated narrow beams of fast protons, and since the range of the beam is easily controllable, precision exposure of well defined small volumes within the body will soon be feasible. Let us examine the properties of fast protons somewhat more quantitatively. Perhaps the most important biological quantity is the specific ionization, or number of ions per centimeter of track. This quantity is not difficult to calculate. The results of such calculations are shown in Figure 1, where the range of protons in tissue is plotted for protons of various energies. In the same figure, the specific ionization is plotted as a function of the range in tissue. For purposes of calculation, tissue has been assumed to have the molecular formula (1): C0.5H8O3.8N0.14, and to be of unit density, i.e., 15 per cent protein and 85 per cent water. The calculations can be easily extended to other materials and densities.2 The accuracy is perhaps 5 per cent.",

We believe that Portland-based cement approaches will dominate in the near future due to economies of scale, levels of process optimisation, availability of raw materials and market confidence. Two product-based approaches can deliver substantial additional reductions in their global CO2 emissions, reducing the need for costly investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) over the next 20\u201330\u202fyears: 1. Increased use of low-CO2 supplements (SCMs) as partial replacements for Portland cement clinker. 2. More efficient use of Portland cement clinker in mortars and concretes.

The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among co-occurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO 2 , climate change and the spread of invasive species.",

    "text":"Mitophagy and Quality Control Mechanisms in Mitochondrial Maintenance. The maintenance of a healthy and functional mitochondrial network is critical during development as well as throughout life in the response to physiological adaptations and stress conditions. Owing to their role in energy production, mitochondria are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species, making them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial DNA mutations and protein misfolding. Given that mitochondria are formed from proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, an additional layer of complexity is inherent in the coordination of protein synthesis and the mitochondrial import of nuclear-encoded proteins. For these reasons, mitochondria have evolved multiple systems of quality control to ensure that the requisite number of functional mitochondria are present to meet the demands of the cell. These pathways work to eliminate damaged mitochondrial proteins or parts of the mitochondrial network by mitophagy and renew components by adding protein and lipids through biogenesis, collectively resulting in mitochondrial turnover. Mitochondrial quality control mechanisms are multi-tiered, operating at the protein, organelle and cell levels. Herein, we discuss mitophagy in different physiological contexts and then relate it to other quality control pathways, including the unfolded protein response, shedding of vesicles, proteolysis, and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Understanding how these pathways contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis could provide insights into the development of targeted treatments when these systems fail in disease.",

Humans are virtually identical in their genetic makeup, yet the small differences in our DNA give rise to tremendous phenotypic diversity across the human population. By contrast, the metagenome of the human microbiome-the total DNA content of microbes inhabiting our bodies-is quite a bit more variable, with only a third of its constituent genes found in a majority of healthy individuals. Understanding this variability in the \"healthy microbiome\" has thus been a major challenge in microbiome research, dating back at least to the 1960s, continuing through the Human Microbiome Project and beyond. Cataloguing the necessary and sufficient sets of microbiome features that support health, and the normal ranges of these features in healthy populations, is an essential first step to identifying and correcting microbial configurations that are implicated in disease. Toward this goal, several population-scale studies have documented the ranges and diversity of both taxonomic compositions and functional potentials normally observed in the microbiomes of healthy populations, along with possible driving factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle. Here, we review several definitions of a 'healthy microbiome' that have emerged, the current understanding of the ranges of healthy microbial diversity, and gaps such as the characterization of molecular function and the development of ecological therapies to be addressed in the future.",

In the continental United States, the timing of the onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-oft) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and climatological data. Predictions were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km x 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7.2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6.1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5.3 days in the DBF biome and 6.3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95% probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lilac phenology. Continental application of the phenology models for 1990-1992 revealed extensive interannual variability in onset and offset. Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of 129 days in 1991 to a high of 146 days in 1992. Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.",

However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3 We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4 This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5 Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.",

    "text":"How strongly can forest management influence soil carbon sequestration?. We reviewed the experimental evidence for long-term carbon (C) sequestration in soils as consequence of specific forest management strategies. Utilization of terrestrial C sinks alleviates the burden of countries which are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Land-use changes such as those which result from afforestation and management of fast-growing tree species, have an immediate effect on the regional rate of C sequestration by incorporating carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant biomass. The potential for such practices is limited in Europe by environmental and political constraints. The management of existing forests can also increase C sequestration, but earlier reviews found conflicting evidence regarding the effects of forest management on soil C pools. We analyzed the effects of harvesting, thinning, fertilization application, drainage, tree species selection, and control of natural disturbances on soil C dynamics. We focused on factors that affect the C input to the soil and the C release via decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). The differentiation of SOM into labile and stable soil C fractions is important. There is ample evidence about the effects of management on the amount of C in the organic layers of the forest floor, but much less information about measurable effects of management on stable C pools in the mineral soil. The C storage capacity of the stable pool can be enhanced by increasing the productivity of the forest and thereby increasing the C input to the soil. Minimizing the disturbances in the stand structure and soil reduces the risk of unintended C losses. The establishment of mixed species forests increases the stability of the forest and can avoid high rates of SOM decomposition. The rate of C accumulation and its distribution within the soil profile differs between tree species. Differences in the stability of SOM as a direct species effect have not yet been reported.",

    "text":"Direct and Indirect Estimation of Leaf Area Index, fAPAR, and Net Primary Production of Terrestrial Ecosystems. A primary objective of the Earth Observing System (EOS) is to develop and validate algorithms to estimate leaf area index (L), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and net primary production (NPP) from remotely sensed products. These three products are important because they relate to or are components of the metabolism of the biosphere and can be determined for terrestrial ecosystems from satellite-borne sensors. The importance of these products in the EOS program necessitates the need to use standard methods to obtain accurate ground truth estimates of L, fAPAR, and NPP that are correlated to satellite-derived estimates. The objective of this article is to review direct and indirect methods used to estimate L, fAPAR, and NPP in terrestrial ecosystems. Direct estimates of L, biomass, and NPP can be obtained by harvesting individual plants, developing allometric equations, and applying these equations to all individuals in the stand. Using non-site-specific allometric equations to estimate L and foliage production can cause large errors because carbon allocation to foliage is influenced by numerous environmental and ecological factors. All of the optical instruments that indirectly estimate L actually estimate \u201ceffective\u201d leaf area index (LE) and underestimate L when foliage in the canopy is nonrandomly distributed (i.e., clumped). We discuss several methods, ranging from simple to complex in terms of data needs, that can be used to correct estimates of L when foliage is clumped. Direct estimates of above-ground and below-ground net primary production (NPPA and NPPB, respectively) are laborious, expensive and can only be carried out for small plots, yet there is a great need to obtain global estimates of NPP. Process models, driven by remotely sensed input parameters, are useful tools to examine the influence of global change on the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems, but an incomplete understanding of carbon allocation continues to hamper development of more accurate NPP models. We summarize carbon allocation patterns for major terrestrial biomes and discuss emerging allocation patterns that can be incorporated into global NPP models. One common process model, light use efficiency or epsilon model, uses remotely sensed fAPAR, light use efficiency (LUE) and carbon allocation coefficients, and other meteorological data to estimates NPP. Such models require reliable estimates of LUE. We summarize the literature and provide LUE coefficients for the major biomes, being careful to correct for inconsistencies in radiation, dry matter and carbon allocation units.",

Physical interactions between genetic elements located throughout the genome play important roles in gene regulation and can be identified with the Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methodology. 3C converts physical chromatin interactions into specific ligation products, which are quantified individually by PCR. Here we present a high-throughput 3C approach, 3C-Carbon Copy (5C), that employs microarrays or quantitative DNA sequencing using 454-technology as detection methods. We applied 5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human \u03b2-globin locus and a 100-kb conserved gene desert region. We validated 5C by detection of several previously identified looping interactions in the \u03b2-globin locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the \u03b2-globin Locus Control Region and the \u03b3\u2013\u03b2-globin intergenic region. Interestingly, this region has been implicated in the control of developmental globin gene switching. 5C should be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis - and trans - interaction networks of genomic elements and for the study of higher-order chromosome structure.",

Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease.",

It will be produced globally at single-pixel resolution; the algorithm uses as many as 14 of the MEDIS 36 spectral bands to maximize reliable cloud detection and to mitigate past difficulties experienced by sensors with coarser spatial resolution or fewer spectral bands. The MEDIS cloud mask is ancillary input to MEDIS land, ocean, and atmosphere science algorithms to suggest processing options. The MEDIS cloud mask algorithm will operate in near real time in a limited computer processing and storage facility with simple easy-to-follow algorithm paths. The MEDIS cloud mask algorithm identifies several conceptual domains according to surface type and solar illumination, including land, water, snow\/ice, desert, and coast for both day and night. Once a pixel has been assigned to a particular domain (defining an algorithm path), a series of threshold tests attempts to detect the presence of clouds in the instrument field of view. Each cloud detection test returns a confidence level that the pixel is clear ranging in value from 1 (high) to zero (low). There are several types of tests, where detection of different cloud conditions relies on different tests. Tests capable of detecting similar cloud conditions are grouped together. While these groups are arranged so that independence between them is maximized, few, if any, spectral tests are completely independent. The minimum confidence from all tests within a group is taken to be representative of that group. These confidences indicate absence of particular cloud types. The product of all the group confidences is used to determine the confidence of finding clear-sky conditions. This paper outlines the MEDIS cloud masking algorithm. While no present sensor has all of the spectral bands necessary for testing the complete MEDIS cloud mask, initial validation of some of the individual cloud tests is presented using existing remote sensing data sets.",

    "text":"Strategies to adapt to an uncertain climate change. Many decisions concerning long-lived investments already need to take into account climate change. But doing so is not easy for at least two reasons. First, due to the rate of climate change, new infrastructure will have to be able to cope with a large range of changing climate conditions, which will make design more difficult and construction more expensive. Second, uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design, and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate information will not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models, therefore, future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions. This aim implies that users of climate information must also change their practices and decision-making frameworks, for instance by adapting the uncertainty-management methods they currently apply to exchange rates or R&D outcomes. Five methods are examined: (i) selecting \u201cno-regret\u201d strategies that yield benefits even in absence of climate change; (ii) favouring reversible and flexible options; (iii) buying \u201csafety margins\u201d in new investments; (iv) promoting soft adaptation strategies, including long-term prospective; and (v) reducing decision time horizons.

Quantum-chemical computations of solids benefit enormously from numerically efficient plane-wave (PW) basis sets, and together with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method, the latter have risen to one of the predominant standards in computational solid-state sciences. Despite their advantages, plane waves lack local information, which makes the interpretation of local densities-of-states (DOS) difficult and precludes the direct use of atom-resolved chemical bonding indicators such as the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) techniques. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed to overcome this fundamental issue, built around the concept of basis-set projection onto a local auxiliary basis. In this work, we propose a novel computational technique toward this goal by transferring the PW\/PAW wavefunctions to a properly chosen local basis using analytically derived expressions. In particular, we describe a general approach to project both PW and PAW eigenstates onto given custom orbitals, which we then exemplify at the hand of contracted multiple-\u03b6 Slater-type orbitals. The validity of the method presented here is illustrated by applications to chemical textbook examples\u2014diamond, gallium arsenide, the transition-metal titanium\u2014as well as nanoscale allotropes of carbon: a nanotube and the fullerene. Remarkably, the analytical approach not only recovers the total and projected electronic DOS with a high degree of confidence, but it also yields a realistic chemical-bonding picture in the framework of the projected COHP method. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "text":"Coding of Odors by a Receptor Repertoire. We provide a systematic analysis of how odor quality, quantity, and duration are encoded by the odorant receptor repertoire of the Drosophila antenna. We test the receptors with a panel of over 100 odors and find that strong responses are sparse, with response density dependent on chemical class. Individual receptors range along a continuum from narrowly tuned to broadly tuned. Broadly tuned receptors are most sensitive to structurally similar odorants. Strikingly, inhibitory responses are widespread among receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire provide a rich representation of odor quality, quantity, and duration. Receptors with similar odor sensitivity often map to widely dispersed glomeruli in the antennal lobe. We construct a multidimensional \u201codor space\u201d based on the responses of each individual receptor and find that the positions of odors depend on their chemical class, concentration, and molecular complexity. The space provides a basis for predicting behavioral responses to odors.

The space provides a basis for predicting behavioral responses to odors. Sensory systems produce internal representations of external stimuli. A fundamental problem in neurobiology is how the defining aspects of a stimulus, such as its quality, quantity, and temporal structure, are encoded by the activity of sensory receptors. The problem is particularly intriguing in the case of olfactory stimuli, which are not related according to a single, continuous function such as wavelength or frequency. Odorants, rather, have discrete molecular structures and differ with respect to a variety of physicochemical properties. Moreover, the natural odors that an olfactory system must encode are generally complex mixtures of varying concentration and duration. Previous studies of the molecular basis of odor coding have focused, with few exceptions, on one or a small number of receptors and odors. However, a clear understanding of odor coding requires a more global perspective in which the receptor repertoire of an entire olfactory organ is considered as a whole and analyzed with olfactory stimuli that vary widely in their features. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides an excellent model system for the study of odor coding. Its olfactory system is similar in organization to that of other insects and vertebrates yet is small in size and easily amenable to molecular, genetic, and electrophysiological analysis (Hallem and Carlson, 2004Hallem E. Carlson J. The odor coding system of Drosophila.Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Drosophila adult has two olfactory organs, the antenna and the maxillary palp, which contain only \u223c1200 and \u223c120 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), respectively (Shanbhag et al., 1999Shanbhag S. Muller B. Steinbrecht A. Atlas of olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster. 1. Types, external organization, innervation and distribution of olfactory sensilla.Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1999; 28: 377-397Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ORNs are found within sensory hairs called sensilla, of which there are three major morphological types: basiconic, coeloconic, and trichoid. Each sensillum contains the dendrites of up to four ORNs. In both insects and mammals, activated ORNs produce sequences of action potentials that reflect the features of the odors that activate them (Bichao et al., 2003Bichao H. Borg-Karlson A. Araujo J.

In Drosophila, extensive electrophysiological analysis of the antennal basiconic sensilla identified 18 functional classes of ORNs, which are found in stereotyped combinations within eight functional types of sensilla (de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M.

Odorant receptors are seven-transmembrane-domain proteins encoded by large gene families. Drosophila has a highly diverse family of 60 odorant receptor (Or) genes, of which individual members are expressed in different subsets of ORNs (Clyne et al., 1999Clyne P. Warr C. Freeman M.

An olfactory sensory map in the fly brain.Cell. 2000; 102: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). We recently examined the antennal odorant receptors of Drosophila (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E. Ho M. Carlson J. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) using a mutant antennal neuron that lacks endogenous odorant receptors, \u201cthe empty neuron,\u201d as an in vivo expression system (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A. van der Goes van Naters W. Warr C.G. Steinbrecht R.A. Carlson J.R. Integrating the molecular and cellular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2003; 37: 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Receptors were expressed in the empty neuron, and odorant responses were assayed electrophysiologically (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Thirty-one of thirty-two receptors that were shown to be expressed in the antenna in an in situ hybridization study (Vosshall et al., 2000Vosshall L. Wong A. Axel R. An olfactory sensory map in the fly brain.Cell. 2000; 102: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) were tested in the empty neuron. Twenty-four of these receptors conferred odor responses and were therefore confirmed to be functional. This analysis revealed that the odorant receptor determines not only the odor response spectrum of the ORN in which it is expressed but also its spontaneous firing rate, response dynamics, and signaling mode (whether the response is excitatory or inhibitory) (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E. Ho M. Carlson J. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Here we provide a systematic analysis of how the antennal receptor repertoire encodes a large collection of odor stimuli that vary widely in identity, intensity, and duration. We examine the response of each receptor to a diverse panel of over 100 odorants, yielding 2640 odorant-receptor combinations. We find that nearly all odorants elicit a response from at least one receptor. Some classes of chemicals elicit many more strong responses than others. Individual receptors range along a continuum from narrowly tuned to broadly tuned. The broadly tuned receptors show strong excitatory responses to \u226520% of the tested odorants but are most sensitive to odorants that are structurally similar. Most receptors exhibit inhibitory as well as excitatory responses. Most receptors respond to complex natural odor mixtures, but one class of receptors responded to no tested odors and may include pheromone receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire are rich in information about odor identity, intensity, and duration. We construct a multidimensional \u201codor space\u201d based on the responses of individual receptors and find that the map position of an odor in the space depends on chemical class, concentration, and molecular complexity. Finally, we investigate the functional organization of the glomeruli to which the receptors map in the AL of the brain; glomeruli have been found to exhibit ordered chemotopy in other organisms. We find that receptors with similar response properties often map to broadly distributed glomeruli. Our results provide understanding of the molecular logic by which the quality, quantity, and temporal structure of an odor are encoded across a receptor repertoire. We systematically analyzed the responses of each of the 24 antennal receptors to a large and diverse panel of odorants using the empty neuron system. Previous studies of antennal odorant receptors with defined odor panels have used very small numbers of odorants (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A. van der Goes van Naters W. Warr C.G.

Functional expression and characterization of a Drosophila odorant receptor in a heterologous cell system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9377-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In particular, our previous study of the antennal receptor repertoire used a panel of 10 odorants (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E. Ho M. Carlson J. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, some of the most fundamental principles of odor coding\u2014for example, the tuning breadth of individual receptors and the extent of combinatorial coding\u2014can only be incisively investigated with a large number of chemically diverse odorants. For the current study, we therefore expanded the dimension of the odorant panel by an order of magnitude: We selected 100 additional odorants. Our reasoning was that those conclusions derived from a study of 10 odors that withstood further scrutiny with a set of 100 odors are, by induction, the conclusions that are most likely to apply to odor sets of order 10n. Accordingly, from the immense number of odors a fly encounters in nature, we selected 100 odorants and added them to the original 10 to generate a panel of 110 odorants. The odorants were chosen to represent a broad sampling of ecologically relevant odors and include esters, alcohols, ketones, lactones, aldehydes, terpenes, organic acids, amines, sulfur compounds, and aromatics (Figure 1). The panel includes compounds of widely ranging chain lengths and also small odorants that may be of particular significance in the chemical ecology of Drosophila, such as ethanol, ammonia, and dimethyl sulfide. Most of the odorants are found in fruits, and some are products of fermentation (TNO, 2004TNO (2004). Volatile Compounds in Food: Qualitative and Quantitative Data. http:\/\/www.vcf-online.nl.Google Scholar). We tested the 2640 odorant-receptor combinations individually by single-unit electrophysiology (Figure 1; Table S1; see Figure S2 for an alternative representation). Of these combinations, 72% yielded little if any response (<50 spikes\/s) and are indicated as \u201c\u2022\u201d in Figure 1, even though the odorant concentrations were deliberately set relatively high for this initial analysis (see Experimental Procedures). Only 445 odorant-receptor combinations, or 17%, resulted in responses of \u226550 spikes\/s; only 234 combinations, or 9%, produced a strong response of \u2265100 spikes\/s; and only 69 of the combinations, or 3%, resulted in very strong responses of \u2265200 spikes\/s (Figure 1). Thus, when examined at a system-wide level, strong or even modest odor responses across the receptor repertoire were sparse, even at high odorant concentrations. Inhibitory responses were strikingly prevalent: 300 odorant-receptor combinations, or 11%, resulted in inhibitory responses (Figure 1). Most receptors are inhibited by at least one odorant, and most odorants inhibit at least one receptor. The distribution of responses varied among chemical classes. The density of strong responses (\u2265100 spikes\/s) was higher among esters (16%) and alcohols (18%) than terpenes (1%) or organic acids (2%), while the density of inhibitory responses was higher among aromatics (18%) than any other chemical class (Figure 1; Figure S2). These results suggest that the receptor repertoire may have an especially high degree of discriminatory power with which to resolve alcohols, esters, and aromatics by means of combinatorial coding. We generated tuning curves for each receptor (Figure 2A). There is great variability in the number of odorants that elicit a strong excitatory response (\u2265100 spikes\/s) from each receptor. The first seven receptors shown in Figure 2A (Or47b through Or85f) were not strongly excited by any odorant. Or82a was strongly excited by 1 of the 110 tested odorants, Or10a by 9 odorants, and Or67a by 31 odorants. The results do not reveal a bimodal distribution of narrowly tuned and broadly tuned receptors, but rather a continuum of tuning breadths (Figure 2B). A number of the more broadly tuned receptors responded strongly to odorants with diverse chemical structures (Figure 1). For example, Or67a was strongly excited by a lactone, organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, alcohols, and esters. Of the 16 receptors that were strongly excited by more than one odorant, almost all were strongly excited by odorants of more than one chemical class. Or49b was exceptional in that the three odorants that elicited strong excitatory responses all contain a benzene ring. Receptors also varied continuously in the number of odorants that inhibit them (Figure 2B). Some receptors were inhibited by as many as \u223c30% of all tested odorants. How many receptors are activated by each odor? Fifteen odorants elicited \u226550 spikes\/s from more than ten receptors, but only one odorant (1-hexanol) elicited \u2265100 spikes\/s from nine receptors, and only five odorants elicited \u2265100 spikes\/s from each of eight receptors (Figure 2C). Of 17 odorants that activated six or more receptors to \u2265100 spikes\/s, 7 are alcohols and 9 are esters. Inhibitory responses were elicited from multiple receptors by most odorants (Figure 2C). The odorant that elicited the most inhibitory responses was 2-methylphenol, an aromatic. Some receptors show a strong response to one odorant but no response to a structurally similar odorant. For example, Or49b, which shows excitatory responses only to aromatic compounds (Figure 1), is selective among aromatic compounds. It responds to 2-methylphenol and a number of other small aromatics, including benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, and acetophenone, but the larger aromatics phenethyl acetate, ethyl cinnamate, and 4-ethylguaiacol do not elicit responses (Figure S3A). For this receptor, the presence of an aromatic ring, as well as the size of the molecule, appears to be a factor in determining binding specificity. Another receptor, Or10a, responds strongly to the aromatic compounds ethyl benzoate, methyl benzoate, methyl salicylate, acetophenone, and benzaldehyde (Figure S3B). However, the structurally similar aromatics 4-ethylguaiacol, benzyl alcohol, and ethyl cinnamate elicit little if any response. Thus, all of the strong aromatic ligands for Or10a contain not only a benzene ring but also a carbonyl group on the primary carbon atom. The presence of both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group and their close proximity may be determinants of odorant binding to Or10a. However, while these features may be sufficient to elicit a strong response from Or10a, not all are necessary: Or10 also responds very strongly to two aliphatic compounds, isobutyl acetate and isopentyl acetate (Figure 1). One possible implication of these results, taken together, is that the response of some Or proteins to particular odorants may be difficult to predict. Some individual receptors responded strongly to \u226520% of the tested odorants (Figures 2A and 2B). In this analysis, odorants were administered as \u201c10\u22122\u201d dilutions (see Experimental Procedures), as in previous studies (de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.

Turner G. Laurent G. Transformation of olfactory representations in the Drosophila antennal lobe.Science. 2004; 303: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We wished to know whether these receptors retained their promiscuity or appeared more selective when tested with odorants at lower concentrations. Accordingly, we examined the odor response specificities of the four most broadly tuned receptors at odor concentrations spanning seven orders of magnitude. We found that at lower concentrations, fewer odorants elicited strong responses from these receptors (Figure 3). For example, of the ten odorants that elicited the strongest responses from Or35a at a 10\u22122 dilution, only four elicited strong responses (\u2265100 spikes\/s) from Or35a when tested at 10\u22124 dilutions, and only one elicited a strong response when tested at a 10\u22126 dilution. The four odorants that continued to elicit strong responses from Or35a at 10\u22124 dilutions are structurally related. All four are six-carbon chains containing a terminal hydroxyl group (Figure 3). Likewise, fewer odorants elicited strong responses from the other receptors when tested at lower concentrations, and the most effective odorants for each receptor are closely related. Thus, even the most broadly tuned receptors are narrowly tuned at low concentrations. We expanded the analysis of dose dependence to include all 24 receptors, which we tested with a diverse subset of odorants. We found that at high concentrations, most odorants activated multiple receptors (Figure 4A). However, at lower concentrations of odorants, strong responses were sparse: Each of the five odorants that elicited responses of \u226550 spikes\/s at a 10\u22126 dilution activated only a single receptor (Figure 4A; Table S2). Such odor representations are likely to be produced in a flying insect, for example, which encounters relatively low odorant concentrations. Animals in nature rarely encounter pure odorants, but rather encounter complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds. We examined the responses of the antennal receptor repertoire to nine complex mixtures of odors\u2014natural extracts of apple, apricot, banana, cherry, mango, peach, pineapple, raspberry, and strawberry\u2014by systematically testing these fruit odors at a range of concentrations spanning seven orders of magnitude. We found that most receptors are responsive to fruit odors (Figure 4B; Table S2). At the highest concentration tested, 16 receptors (67%) responded strongly (\u2265100 spikes\/s) to the odor of at least one fruit, 13 to at least two fruits, and 9 to at least three fruits (Table S2). Thus, most receptors respond strongly to fruit odors, and many fruit odors strongly activate multiple receptors. A small subset of receptors showed virtually no excitatory responses to any of the fruit odors tested. Three receptors\u2014Or47b, Or65a, and Or88a\u2014did not respond to any fruit odors or pure odorants above a rate of 50 spikes\/s. These results suggest that while most receptors have evolved to detect or evaluate food sources, these receptors may have evolved to sense other classes of chemical information, such as pheromones. This possibility is supported by the expression of these receptors in trichoid sensilla, which are known to detect pheromones in other insects (Christensen and Hildebrand, 2002Christensen T. Hildebrand J. Pheromonal and host-odor processing in the insect antennal lobe: how different?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Or47b in particular is expressed in sensilla that also express the male-specific isoform of the transcription factor fruitless (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.

Interestingly, Or47b showed inhibitory responses to 34% of all tested odorants, more than any other tested receptor (Figure 2B). These results suggest that inhibition may be particularly important as a means of noise reduction in channels that transmit specific signals of particular biological significance. There is an expanding body of evidence that the temporal structure of olfactory information is critical to odor coding (Laurent et al., 2001Laurent G. Stopfer M. Friedrich R. Rabinovich M. Volkovskii A. Abarbanel H. Odor encoding as an active, dynamical process: experiments, computation, and theory.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 263-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Since the initial representation of an odor lies in the differential activities of the receptors, the dynamics of receptor activity provide a temporal structure on which all subsequent representations are based. However, there has been remarkably little analysis of the temporal structure of this initial representation. We demonstrated earlier, using several receptors and several odors, that the response kinetics of an ORN are determined by the odorant receptor that it expresses (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E. Ho M. Carlson J. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). We have now systematically investigated the temporal structure of the primary odor representation by examining the firing frequencies of all 24 receptors as a function of time. Firing frequencies were quantified over the course of a 2 s period beginning at the onset of odor stimulation, and responses were plotted to generate a \u201ctemporal surface\u201d for each of a panel of odors. We found that some odorants, such as methyl salicylate at a 10\u22122 dilution, elicited a pattern of receptor activation that was relatively constant throughout the 2 s time interval (Figure 5A; Tables S3 and S4). By contrast, other odorants elicited patterns of receptor activation that were highly dynamic over the time interval. For example, of the receptors that initially responded to a 10\u22122 dilution of pentyl acetate, some stopped responding during this time interval, while others continued to respond at nearly the same rate throughout the interval. The temporal surfaces for these odors contain a number of deep folds: Among the receptors that respond at the highest initial rates, some showed much more rapid declines in firing rates than others. At lower concentrations, many odorants elicited a prolonged response from only one receptor or from no receptors (Figure 5B, Tables S3 and S4). Thus, odors differ in the temporal dynami",

    "text":"Post-combustion CO2 capture with chemical absorption: A state-of-the-art review. Abstract Global concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing rapidly. CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate change. Effective CO2 emission abatement strategies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are required to combat this trend. There are three major approaches for CCS: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel process. Post-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used without radical changes on them. This makes post-combustion capture easier to implement as a retrofit option (to existing power plants) compared to the other two approaches. Therefore, post-combustion capture is probably the first technology that will be deployed. This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far in post-combustion capture with chemical absorption. The technology will be introduced first, followed by required preparation of flue gas from power plants to use this technology. The important research programmes worldwide and the experimental studies based on pilot plants will be reviewed. This is followed by an overview of various studies based on modelling and simulation. Then the focus is turned to review development of different solvents and process intensification. Based on these, we try to predict challenges and potential new developments from different aspects such as new solvents, pilot plants, process heat integration (to improve efficiency), modelling and simulation, process intensification and government policy impact.",

Abstract Benefitting from the flexibility in engineering their optical response, metamaterials have been used to achieve control over the propagation of light to an unprecedented level, leading to highly unconventional and versatile optical functionalities compared with their natural counterparts. Recently, the emerging field of metasurfaces, which consist of a monolayer of photonic artificial atoms, has offered attractive functionalities for shaping wave fronts of light by introducing an abrupt interfacial phase discontinuity. Here we realize three-dimensional holography by using metasurfaces made of subwavelength metallic nanorods with spatially varying orientations. The phase discontinuity takes place when the helicity of incident circularly polarized light is reversed. As the phase can be continuously controlled in each subwavelength unit cell by the rod orientation, metasurfaces represent a new route towards high-resolution on-axis three-dimensional holograms with a wide field of view. In addition, the undesired effect of multiple diffraction orders usually accompanying holography is eliminated.",

    "text":"Plant Breeding and Drought in C3 Cereals: What Should We Breed For?. Drought is the main abiotic constraint on cereal yield. Analysing physiological determinants of yield responses to water may help in breeding for higher yield and stability under drought conditions. The traits to select (either for stress escape, avoidance or tolerance) and the framework where breeding for drought stress is addressed will depend on the level and timing of stress in the targeted area. If the stress is severe, breeding under stress-free conditions may be unsuccessful and traits that confer survival may become a priority. However, selecting for yield itself under stress-alleviated conditions appears to produce superior cultivars, not only for optimum environments, but also for those characterized by frequent mild and moderate stress conditions. This implies that broad avoidance\/tolerance to mild-moderate stresses is given by constitutive traits also expressed under stress-free conditions. In this paper, we focus on physiological traits that contribute to improved productivity under mild-moderate drought. Increased crop performance may be achieved through improvements in water use, water-use efficiency and harvest index. The first factor is relevant when soil water remains available at maturity or when deep-rooted genotypes access water in the soil profile that is not normally available; the two latter conditions become more important when all available water is exhausted by the end of the crop cycle. Independent of the mechanism operating, a canopy able to use more water than another would have more open stomata and therefore higher canopy temperature depression, and 13C discrimination (delta13C) in plant matter. The same traits would also seem to be relevant when breeding for hot, irrigated environments. Where additional water is not available to the crop, higher water-use efficiency (WUE) appears to be an alternative strategy to improve crop performance. In this context delta13C constitutes a simple but reliable measure of WUE. However, in contrast to lines performing better because of increased access to water, lines producing greater biomass due to superior WUE will have lower delta13C values. WUE may be modified not only through a decrease in stomatal conductance, but also through an increase in photosynthetic capacity. Harvest index is strongly reduced by terminal drought (i.e. drought during grain filling). Thus, phenological traits increasing the relative amount of water used during grain filling, or adjusting the crop cycle to the seasonal pattern of rainfall may be useful. Augmenting the contribution of carbohydrate reserves accumulated during vegetative growth to grain filling may also be worthwhile in harsh environmcnts. Alternatively, extending the duration of stem elongation without changing the timing of anthesis would increase the number of grains per spike and the harvest index without changing the amount of water utilized by the crop.",

The need for energy storage to balance intermittent and inflexible electricity supply with demand is driving interest in conversion of renewable electricity via electrolysis into a storable gas. But, high capital cost and uncertainty regarding future cost and performance improvements are barriers to investment in water electrolysis. Expert elicitations can support decision-making when data are sparse and their future development uncertain. Therefore, this study presents expert views on future capital cost, lifetime and efficiency for three electrolysis technologies: alkaline (AEC), proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Experts estimate that increased R&D funding can reduce capital costs by 0\u201324%, while production scale-up alone has an impact of 17\u201330%. System lifetimes may converge at around 60,000\u201390,000 h and efficiency improvements will be negligible. In addition to innovations on the cell-level, experts highlight improved production methods to automate manufacturing and produce higher quality components. Research into SOECs with lower electrode polarisation resistance or zero-gap AECs could undermine the projected dominance of PEMEC systems. This study thereby reduces barriers to investment in water electrolysis and shows how expert elicitations can help guide near-term investment, policy and research efforts to support the development of electrolysis for low-carbon energy systems.",

    "text":"Yield gap analysis with local to global relevance\u2014A review. Yields of crops must increase substantially over the coming decades to keep pace with global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers\u2019 yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95th percentiles of farmers\u2019 yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers\u2019 yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments.",

    "text":"Forest soils and carbon sequestration. Soils in equilibrium with a natural forest ecosystem have high carbon (C) density. The ratio of soil:vegetation C density increases with latitude. Land use change, particularly conversion to agricultural ecosystems, depletes the soil C stock. Thus, degraded agricultural soils have lower soil organic carbon (SOC) stock than their potential capacity. Consequently, afforestation of agricultural soils and management of forest plantations can enhance SOC stock through C sequestration. The rate of SOC sequestration, and the magnitude and quality of soil C stock depend on the complex interaction between climate, soils, tree species and management, and chemical composition of the litter as determined by the dominant tree species. Increasing production of forest biomass per se may not necessarily increase the SOC stocks. Fire, natural or managed, is an important perturbation that can affect soil C stock for a long period after the event. The soil C stock can be greatly enhanced by a careful site preparation, adequate soil drainage, growing species with a high NPP, applying N and micronutrients (Fe) as fertilizers or biosolids, and conserving soil and water resources. Climate change may also stimulate forest growth by enhancing availability of mineral N and through the CO2 fertilization effect, which may partly compensate release of soil C in response to warming. There are significant advances in measurement of soil C stock and fluxes, and scaling of C stock from pedon\/plot scale to regional and national scales. Soil C sequestration in boreal and temperate forests may be an important strategy to ameliorate changes in atmospheric chemistry.",

RE\/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by the sol\u2013gel method using rare earth (RE=La3+, Ce3+, Er3+, Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Sm3+) metal salts and tetra-n-butyl titanate as precursors, and were characterized by XRD, IR, UV\u2013vis diffuse reflection, and transient absorption spectra. Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated using nitrite as a decomposition objective. As a result, suitable content of doping rare earth in TiO2 can efficiently extend the light absorption properties to the visible region. At the same time, it is beneficial to NO2\u2212 adsorption over the catalysts due to rare earth doping. RE\/TiO2 samples can enhance the photocatalytic activity to some extent as compared with naked TiO2. The increase in photoactivity is probably due to the higher adsorption, red shifts to a longer wavelength, and the increase in the interfacial electron transfer rate. Nitrite is almost completely degraded over RE\/TiO2 catalysts after longer irradiation, which is different from Degussa P-25 with a plateau of activity after ca. 20 min irradiation. Gd3+-doped TiO2 showed the highest reaction activity among all concerned RE-doped samples because of its specific characteristics. The amount of RE doping was an important factor affecting photocatalytic activity; the optimum amount of RE doping is ca. 0.5 wt%, at which each RE\/TiO2 sample shows the most reactivity. The photocatalytic degradation reaction of nitrite over Gd3+-doped samples and P-25 follows apparent first order kinetics, which is different from that of Sm3+, Ce3+, Er3+, Pr3+, La3+, and Nd3+-doped TiO2 catalysts, which obey zero-order kinetics, indicating that these processes were dominated by electron\u2013hole recombination.",

Abstract A new version of the atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model cooperatively produced by the Japanese research community, known as the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), has recently been developed. A century-long control experiment was performed using the new version (MIROC5) with the standard resolution of the T85 atmosphere and 1\u00b0 ocean models. The climatological mean state and variability are then compared with observations and those in a previous version (MIROC3.2) with two different resolutions (medres, hires), coarser and finer than the resolution of MIROC5. A few aspects of the mean fields in MIROC5 are similar to or slightly worse than MIROC3.2, but otherwise the climatological features are considerably better. In particular, improvements are found in precipitation, zonal mean atmospheric fields, equatorial ocean subsurface fields, and the simulation of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation. The difference between MIROC5 and the previous model is larger than that between the two MIROC3.2 versions, indicating a greater effect of updating parameterization schemes on the model climate than increasing the model resolution. The mean cloud property obtained from the sophisticated prognostic schemes in MIROC5 shows good agreement with satellite measurements. MIROC5 reveals an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.6 K, which is lower than that in MIROC3.2 by 1 K. This is probably due to the negative feedback of low clouds to the increasing concentration of CO2, which is opposite to that in MIROC3.2.",

After seven years of plant growth, we determined the composition and function of soil microbial communities beneath experimental plant diversity treatments containing 1\u201316 species. Microbial community biomass, respiration, and fungal abundance significantly increased with greater plant diversity, as did N mineralization rates. However, changes in microbial community biomass, activity, and composition largely resulted from the higher levels of plant production associated with greater diversity, rather than from plant diversity per se. Nonetheless, greater plant production could not explain more rapid N mineralization, indicating that plant diversity affected this microbial process, which controls rates of ecosystem N cycling. Greater N availability probably contributed to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity in the N-limited soils of our experiment, suggesting that plant\u2013microbe interactions in soil are an integral component of plant diversity's influence on ecosystem function.",

Cu NP catalysts in the 2-15 nm mean size range were prepared, and their catalytic activity and selectivity during CO2 electroreduction were analyzed and compared to a bulk Cu electrode. A dramatic increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity for H2 and CO was observed with decreasing Cu particle size, in particular, for NPs below 5 nm. Hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) selectivity was increasingly suppressed for nanoscale Cu surfaces. The size dependence of the surface atomic coordination of model spherical Cu particles was used to rationalize the experimental results. Changes in the population of low-coordinated surface sites and their stronger chemisorption were linked to surging H2 and CO selectivities, higher catalytic activity, and smaller hydrocarbon selectivity. The presented activity-selectivity-size relations provide novel insights in the CO2 electroreduction reaction on nanoscale surfaces.

Reduction by hydroperoxide decomposes persulfate into sulfate radical and sulfate anion, and hydroperoxide is oxidized to superoxide. The base-catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate was supported by kinetic analyses of persulfate decomposition at various base:persulfate molar ratios and an increased rate of persulfate decomposition in D2O vs H2O. Stoichiometric analyses confirmed that hydroperoxide reacts with persulfate in a 1:1 molar ratio. Addition of hydroperoxide to basic persulfate systems resulted in rapid decomposition of the hydroperoxide and persulfate and decomposition of the superoxide probe hexachloroethane. The presence of superoxide was confirmed with scavenging by Cu(II). Electron spin resonance spectroscopy confirmed the generation of sulfate radical, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide. The results of this research are consistent with the widespread reactivity reported for base-activated persulfate when it is used for ISCO.",

We report a series of experiments and a theoretical model designed to systematically define and evaluate the relative importance of nanoparticle, oligonucleotide, and environmental variables that contribute to the observed sharp melting transitions associated with DNA-linked nanoparticle structures. These variables include the size of the nanoparticles, the surface density of the oligonucleotides on the nanoparticles, the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium, target concentration, and the position of the nanoparticles with respect to one another within the aggregate. The experimental data may be understood in terms of a thermodynamic model that attributes the sharp melting to a cooperative mechanism that results from two key factors: the presence of multiple DNA linkers between each pair of nanoparticles and a decrease in the melting temperature as DNA strands melt due to a concomitant reduction in local salt concentration. The cooperative melting effect, originating from short-range duplex-to-duplex interactions, is independent of DNA base sequences studied and should be universal for any type of nanostructured probe that is heavily functionalized with oligonucleotides. Understanding the fundamental origins of the melting properties of DNA-linked nanoparticle aggregates (or monolayers) is of paramount importance because these properties directly impact one's ability to formulate high sensitivity and selectivity DNA detection systems and construct materials from these novel nanoparticle materials.",

Abstract Environmental theories of African faunal evolution state that important evolutionary changes during the Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene interval (the last ca. 5.3 million years) were mediated by changes in African climate or shifts in climate variability. Marine sediment sequences demonstrate that subtropical African climate periodically oscillated between markedly wetter and drier conditions, paced by earth orbital variations, with evidence for step-like (\u00b10.2 Ma) increases in African climate variability and aridity near 2.8 Ma, 1.7 Ma, and 1.0 Ma, coincident with the onset and intensification of high-latitude glacial cycles. Analysis of the best dated and most complete African mammal fossil databases indicates African faunal assemblage and, perhaps, speciation changes during the Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene, suggesting more varied and open habitats at 2.9\u20132.4 Ma and after 1.8 Ma. These intervals correspond to key junctures in early hominid evolution, including the emergence of our genus Homo. Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene shifts in African climate, vegetation, and faunal assemblages thus appear to be roughly contemporary, although detailed comparisons are hampered by sampling gaps, dating uncertainties, and preservational biases in the fossil record. Further study of possible relations between African faunal and climatic change will benefit from the accelerating pace of important new fossil discoveries, emerging molecular biomarker methods for reconstructing African paleovegetation changes, tephra correlations between terrestrial and marine sequences, as well as continuing collaborations between the paleoclimatic and paleoanthropological communities.",

Abstract As a fascinating conjugated polymer, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been the hotspot in the materials science as a metal-free and visible-light-responsive photocatalyst. Pure g-C3N4 suffers from the insufficient sunlight absorption, low surface area and the fast recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, resulting in low photocatalytic activity. Element doping is known to be an efficient method to tune the unique electronic structure and band gap of g-C3N4, which considerably broaden the light responsive range and enhance the charge separation. This review summarizes the recent progress in the development of efficient and low cost doped g-C3N4 systems in various realms such as photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, reduction of carbon dioxide, photocatalytic removal of contaminants in wastewater and gas phase. Typically, metal doping, nonmetal doping, co-doping and heterojunction based on doped g-C3N4 have been explored to simultaneously tune the crystallographic, textural and electronic structures for improving photocatalytic activity by enhancing the light absorption, facilitating the charge separation and transportation and prolonging the charge carrier lifetime. Finally, the current challenges and the crucial issues of element doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts that need to be addressed in future research are presented. This review presented herein can pave a novel avenue and add invaluable knowledge to the family of element doped g-C3N4 for the develop of more effective visible-light-driven photocatalysts.",

For the first time, the indices based on daily temperature and precipitation are calculated with a consistent methodology across multimodel simulations and four reanalysis data sets (ERA40, ERA-Interim, NCEP\/NCAR, and NCEP-DOE) and are made available at the ETCCDI indices archive website. Our analyses show that the CMIP5 models are generally able to simulate climate extremes and their trend patterns as represented by the indices in comparison to a gridded observational indices data set (HadEX2). The spread amongst CMIP5 models for several temperature indices is reduced compared to CMIP3 models, despite the larger number of models participating in CMIP5. Some improvements in the CMIP5 ensemble relative to CMIP3 are also found in the representation of the magnitude of precipitation indices. We find substantial discrepancies between the reanalyses, indicating considerable uncertainties regarding their simulation of extremes. The overall performance of individual models is summarized by a \u201cportrait\u201d diagram based on root-mean-square errors of model climatologies for each index and model relative to four reanalyses. This metric analysis shows that the median model climatology outperforms individual models for all indices, but the uncertainties related to the underlying reference data sets are reflected in the individual model performance metrics.",

Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) is sensitive to a number of controls, including aspects of climate, topography, soils, plant and microbial characteristics, disturbance, and anthropogenic impacts. Yet, at least at the global scale, models based on very different types and numbers of parameters yield similar results. Part of the reason for this is that the major NPP controls influence each other, resulting, under current conditions, in broad correlations among controls. NPP models that include richer suites of controlling parameters should be more sensitive to conditions that disrupt the broad correlations, but the current paucity of global data limits the power of complex models. Improved data sets will facilitate applications of complex models, but many of the critical data are very difficult to produce, especially for applications dealing with the past or future. It may be possible to overcome some of the challenges of data availability through increased understanding and modeling of ecological processes that adjust plant physiology and architecture in relation to resources. The CASA (Carnegie, Stanford, Ames Approach) model introduced by Potter et al. (1993) and expanded here uses a combination of ecological principles, satellite data, and surface data to predict terrestrial NPP on a monthly time step. CASA calculates NPP as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, APAR, and an efficiency of radiation use, \u03f5. The underlying postulate is that some of the limitations on NPP appear in each. CASA estimates annual terrestrial NPP to be 48 Pg and the maximum efficiency of PAR utilization (\u03f5\u2217) to be 0.39 g C MJ\u22121 PAR.

    "text":"Double-Layer in Ionic Liquids: Paradigm Change?. Applications of ionic liquids at electrified interfaces to energy-storage systems, electrowetting devices, or nanojunction gating media cannot proceed without a deep understanding of the structure and properties of the interfacial double layer. This article provides a detailed critique of the present work on this problem. It promotes the point of view that future considerations of ionic liquids should be based on the modern statistical mechanics of dense Coulomb systems, or density-functional theory, rather than classical electrochemical theories which hinge on a dilute-solution approximation. The article will, however, contain more questions than answers. To trigger the discussion, it starts with a simplified original result. A new analytical formula is derived to rationalize the potential dependence of double-layer capacitance at a planar metal\u2212ionic liquid interface. The theory behind it has a mean-field character, based on the Poisson\u2212Boltzmann lattice-gas model, with a modification to account for the finite volume occupied by ions. When the volume of liquid excluded by the ions is taken to be zero (that is, if ions are extremely sparsely packed in the liquid), the expression reduces to the nonlinear Gouy\u2212Chapman law, the canonical result typically used to describe the potential dependence of capacitance in electrochemical double layers. If ionic volume exclusion takes more realistic values, the formula shows that capacitance\u2212potential curves for an ionic liquid may differ dramatically from the Gouy\u2212Chapman law. Capacitance has a maximum close to the potential of zero charge, rather than the familiar minimum. At large potenials, capacitance decreases with the square root of potential, rather than increases exponentially. The reported formula does not take into account the specific adsorption of ions, which, if present, can complicate the analysis of experimental data. Since electrochemists use to think about the capacitance data in terms of the classical Gouy\u2212Chapman theory, which, as we know, should be good only for electrolytes of moderate concentration, the question of which result is \u201cbetter\u201d arises. Experimental data are sparse, but a quick look at them suggests that the new formula seems to be closer to reality. Opinions here could, however, split. Indeed, a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations has shown that incorporation of restricted-volume effects in the mean-field theory of electrolyte solutions may give results that are worse than the simple Gouy\u2212Chapman theory. Generally, should the simple mean-field theory work for such highly concentrated ionic systems, where the so-called ion-correlation effects must be strong? It may not, as it does not incorporate a possibility of charge-density oscillations. Somehow, to answer this question definitely, one should do further work. This could be based on density-functional theory (and possibly not on what is referred to as local density approximation but rather \u201cweighted density approximation\u201d), field theory methods for the account of fluctuations in the calculation of partition function, heuristic integral equation theory extended to the nonlinear response, systematic force-field computer simulations, and, most importantly, experiments with independently determined potentials of zero charge, as discussed in the paper.",

Furthermore, ROS enhancement under stress functions as an alarm signal that triggers acclimatory\/defense responses by specific signal transduction pathways that involve H2O2 as secondary messenger.

To elucidate its role in MS, brain tissues from patients with MS were compared to controls. We detected expression of IL-17 mRNA (by in situ hybridization) and protein (by immunohistochemistry) in perivascular lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes located in the active areas of MS lesions. Further, we found a significant increase in the number of IL-17+ T cells in active rather than inactive areas of MS lesions. Specifically, double immunofluorescence showed that IL-17 immunoreactivity was detected in 79% of T cells in acute lesions, 73% in active areas of chronic active lesions, but in only 17% of those in inactive lesions and 7% in lymph node control tissue. CD8+, as well as CD4+, T cells were equally immunostained for IL-17 in MS tissues. Interestingly, and in contrast to lymph node T cells, no perivascular T cells showed FoxP3 expression, a marker of regulatory T cells, at any stage of MS lesions.

Flagellates, including HAB taxa, collectively have a lower nutrient uptake affinity than diatoms. Four major adaptations are suggested to have been evolved to offset the ecological disadvantages of their low nutrient affinity: nutrient retrieval migrations; mixotrophic tendencies; alle-lelochemically enhanced interspecific competition; and allelopathic, antipredation defense mechanisms. Motility-based behavioral features of flagellates contributing to their blooms include: phototaxis, vertical migration, pattern swimming, and aggregation, which facilitate nutrient retrieval, trace metal detoxification, antipredation, depth-keeping, and turbulence avoidance. Neither a general physiological syndrome nor distinctive physiological profile distinguishes harmful flagellate species from nonharmful taxa.

Exciting new advances in satellite telemetry, genetic analyses and stable isotope chemistry are now making it possible to determine the population and geographical origin of individual birds. Here, we review these new approaches and consider the relevance of understanding migratory connectivity to ecological, evolutionary and conservation issues.",

    "text":"New World Bats Harbor Diverse Influenza A Viruses. Aquatic birds harbor diverse influenza A viruses and are a major viral reservoir in nature. The recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new H17N10 subtype in Central American fruit bats suggests that other New World species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses. Using consensus degenerate RT-PCR, we identified a novel influenza A virus, designated as H18N11, in a flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru. Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses.",

The introduction of new ionic moieties, cations and anions, is extending the properties and classical applications of polyelectrolytes. These new polyelectrolytes are being named polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) in analogy to their monomeric constituents (i.e. cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidonium and anions such as hexafluorophosphate, triflates, amidotriflates). This is giving rise to a new family of functional polymers with particular properties and new applications.

    "text":"Analysis of daily, monthly, and annual burned area using the fourth-generation global fire emissions database (GFED4). [1] We describe the fourth generation of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4) burned area data set, which provides global monthly burned area at 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution from mid-1995 through the present and daily burned area for the time series extending back to August 2000. We produced the full data set by combining 500 m MODIS burned area maps with active fire data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) family of sensors. We found that the global annual area burned for the years 1997 through 2011 varied from 301 to 377Mha, with an average of 348Mha. We assessed the interannual variability and trends in burned area on the basis of a region-specific definition of fire years. With respect to trends, we found a gradual decrease of 1.7Mhayr \u2212 1 ( \u2212 1.4%yr \u2212 1) in Northern Hemisphere Africa since 2000, a gradual increase of 2.3Mhayr \u2212 1 (+1.8%yr \u2212 1) in Southern Hemisphere Africa also since 2000, a slight increase of 0.2Mhayr \u2212 1 (+2.5%yr \u2212 1) in Southeast Asia since 1997, and a rapid decrease of approximately 5.5Mhayr \u2212 1 ( \u2212 10.7%yr \u2212 1) from 2001 through 2011 in Australia, followed by a major upsurge in 2011 that exceeded the annual area burned in at least the previous 14 years. The net trend in global burned area from 2000 to 2012 was a modest decrease of 4.3Mhayr \u2212 1 ( \u2212 1.2%yr \u2212 1).

[1]\u00a0This study provides an overview of projected changes in climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The temperature- and precipitation-based indices are computed with a consistent methodology for climate change simulations using different emission scenarios in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensembles. We analyze changes in the indices on global and regional scales over the 21st century relative to the reference period 1981\u20132000. In general, changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are found to be more pronounced than in indices based on daily maximum temperatures. Extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. In regions, such as Australia, Central America, South Africa, and the Mediterranean, increases in consecutive dry days coincide with decreases in heavy precipitation days and maximum consecutive 5\u2009day precipitation, which indicates future intensification of dry conditions. Particularly for the precipitation-based indices, there can be a wide disagreement about the sign of change between the models in some regions. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most pronounced under RCP8.5, with projected changes exceeding those discussed in previous studies based on SRES scenarios. The complete set of indices is made available via the ETCCDI indices archive to encourage further studies on the various aspects of changes in extremes.",

We conclude that cell-type-specific chromatin organization occurs at the submegabase scale and that architectural proteins shape the genome in hierarchical length scales. Genomes are organized at multiple length scales into sophisticated higher-order architectures (Misteli, 2007Misteli T. Beyond the sequence: cellular organization of genome function.Cell. 2007; 128: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Individual chromosomes occupy distinct spatial territories with respect to each other in interphase nuclei (Cremer and Cremer, 2001Cremer T. Cremer C.

Within each territory, at intermediate length scales of \u223c1\u201310 Mb, compartments of transcriptionally active euchromatin tend to group together, and independent from, compartments of inactive heterochromatin (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

At the subcompartment level, chromatin is further organized into megabase-sized topologically associating domains (TADs) that represent spatial neighborhoods of high-frequency chromatin interactions (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Within TADs, however, the precise features of chromatin folding at the submegabase scale remain poorly understood.

More recently, technologies for genome-wide mapping of chromatin architecture have been described, but comprehensive detection comes at the expense of resolution for mammalian genomes (Hi-C) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar; Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4868) Google Scholar) or is restricted to only interactions mediated by a preselected protein of interest (ChIA-PET) (Handoko et al., 2011Handoko L. Xu H. Li G. Ngan C.Y. Chew E. Schnapp M. Lee C.W. Ye C. Ping J.L. Mulawadi F. et al.CTCF-mediated functional chromatin interactome in pluripotent cells.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar; Li et al., 2012Li G. Ruan X. Auerbach R.K. Sandhu K.S. Zheng M. Wang P. Poh H.M. Goh Y. Lim J. Zhang J. et al.Extensive promoter-centered chromatin interactions provide a topological basis for transcription regulation.Cell. 2012; 148: 84-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a great need to elucidate principles of genome folding at the submegabase scale by mapping 3D chromatin interactions in an unbiased manner at high resolution. Megabase-scale TADs appear to be constant between mammalian cell types and conserved across species (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar; Nora et al., 2012Nora E.P. Lajoie B.R. Schulz E.G. Giorgetti L. Okamoto I. Servant N. Piolot T. van Berkum N.L. Meisig J. Sedat J. et al.Spatial partitioning of the regulatory landscape of the X-inactivation centre.Nature. 2012; 485: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that genome organization at the submegabase scale, e.g., within TADs, plays a critical role in the establishment and\/or maintenance of cellular state. To test this hypothesis, we present an unbiased, large-scale, and high-resolution analysis of 3D chromatin architecture in a continuous developmental system. We employed chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) (Dostie et al., 2006Dostie J. Richmond T.A. Arnaout R.A. Selzer R.R. Lee W.L. Honan T.A. Rubio E.D. Krumm A. Lamb J. Nusbaum C. et al.Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C): a massively parallel solution for mapping interactions between genomic elements.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) in combination with high-throughput sequencing to map higher-order chromatin organization during differentiation of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) cells along the neuroectoderm lineage. An alternating 5C primer design was applied to query long-range chromatin interactions in a massively parallel manner across six 1\u20132 Mb-sized genomic regions around key developmentally regulated genes (Oct4, Nanog, Nestin, Sox2, Klf4, and Olig1-Olig2). Our analyses reveal that distinct combinations of architectural proteins shape the 3D organization of mammalian genomes at different length scales for unique functional purposes during lineage commitment. To investigate cell-type-specific patterns of higher-order chromatin organization, we first derived homogeneous populations of multipotent neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse ES cells using a well-established, four-stage procedure (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar; Okabe et al., 1996Okabe S. Forsberg-Nilsson K. Spiro A.C. Segal M. McKay R.D. Development of neuronal precursor cells and functional postmitotic neurons from embryonic stem cells in vitro.Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis and confocal microscopy coupled with immunofluorescence staining confirmed a >95% pure population of Nestin\/Sox2-postitive, Oct4\/Nanog-negative cells displaying morphological characteristic of NPCs (Figure S1 available online). We then employed 5C in combination with high-throughput sequencing to generate high-resolution long-range interaction maps for two biological replicates of ES cells and ES-derived NPCs (Dostie et al., 2006Dostie J. Richmond T.A. Arnaout R.A. Selzer R.R. Lee W.L. Honan T.A. Rubio E.D. Krumm A. Lamb J. Nusbaum C. et al.Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C): a massively parallel solution for mapping interactions between genomic elements.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). 5C, a high-throughput derivative of 3C, involves the selective amplification of chromatin interactions within specific genomic loci of interest. By preselecting regions to be queried, we were able to obtain insight into chromatin architecture at the resolution of single interrogated fragments (\u223c4 kb), which is not yet feasible in a cost-effective manner with genome-wide Hi-C technologies in mammalian systems. Forward and reverse 5C primers were designed in an alternating scheme using tools from the publicly available my5C suite (Lajoie et al., 2009Lajoie B.R. van Berkum N.L. Sanyal A. Dekker J. My5C: web tools for chromosome conformation capture studies.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 690-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure S2E). The tiled, alternating design queried \u223c90,000 cis and \u223c500,000 trans interactions in parallel across seven genomic loci surrounding developmentally regulated genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, Nestin, Olig1-Olig2, and gene-desert control) (Table S1). We first evaluated the quality of our raw 5C data by (1) assessing consistency between biological replicates and (2) comparing our high-resolution 5C data to Hi-C data recently reported at 40 kb resolution for E14 ES cells and primary cells isolated from mouse cortex (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar). Raw 5C counts were highly correlated between replicates (ES 1 versus ES 2, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.91; NPC 1 versus NPC 2, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.89) and more correlated than between ES cells and NPCs (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.70) when considering the log of counts for all fragment combinations with >100 reads. Furthermore, heatmaps of raw 5C data showed high similarity between biological replicates at each individual locus (Figure S2F), suggesting that region-specific primers amplified each region in a robust and consistent manner. Importantly, we also observe a striking similarity between global topological features in 5C and Hi-C data for all regions queried, albeit with marked differences in resolution (Figure S3). These results indicate that our 5C libraries are high quality, consistent between replicates, and achieve notable similarity to data generated with an independent method (Hi-C) in an independent study with similar cellular phenotypes. We next examined large-scale architectural features by visualizing heatmaps of 5C counts in ES cells and NPCs (Figures 1C and 1F ). Comparison of high-resolution 5C maps to Hi-C maps at each region revealed a complex hierarchy of chromatin organization. TADs are readily detected in both Hi-C and 5C data sets. Importantly, the higher resolution of 5C data revealed that TADs previously defined with Hi-C are further subdivided into smaller subtopologies (sub-TADs). We systematically identified sub-TADs in 5C data with a Hidden Markov Model-based approach (Extended Experimental Procedures). Using this method, we uncovered numerous distinct subtopologies arranged in a hierarchy within the larger TAD organization. Indeed, >60 invariant and cell-type-specific sub-TAD boundaries were identified with our 5C data at the submegabase scale, whereas only 7 TAD boundaries were called in our regions of interest with a previous Hi-C analysis (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar) (Figures 1G and 1H). Topological features were unique to each region (Figure S3), suggesting that each genomic locus has an architectural signature that may reflect the functional activity of that region. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 5C achieves a marked increase in resolution compared to Hi-C, which enables mapping of finer-scale architectural features within TADs. Our observation that submegabase-scale architectural features undergo marked changes between cell types prompted us to systematically identify constitutive and cell-type-specific looping interactions within and between larger-scale TADs. To account for bias intrinsic to all 3C-based methods, as well as to 5C specifically, we developed a probabilistic model that simultaneously captures the distance-dependent background level of nonspecific chromatin interactions and the nonbiological contribution from each primer (Imakaev et al., 2012Imakaev M. Fudenberg G. McCord R.P. Naumova N. Goloborodko A. Lajoie B.R. Dekker J. Mirny L.A. Iterative correction of Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar; Yaffe and Tanay, 2011Yaffe E. Tanay A. Probabilistic modeling of Hi-C contact maps eliminates systematic biases to characterize global chromosomal architecture.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (Extended Experimental Procedures). Our model produces an interaction score that is comparable within and between experiments and allows for robust detection of fragment-to-fragment looping interactions that are significant above the expected background signal (Figure S4). 3D contacts with interaction scores greater than stringent, pre-established thresholds in both biological replicates were subjected to further analysis (Figure 2A). To rigorously minimize false positives, thresholds were selected so that the large majority of cell-type-specific interactions were lost when randomly permuting data (Figure 2B). By applying these stringent thresholds, we identified 83 ES-cell-specific interactions that are lost upon differentiation, 260 constitutive interactions that are constant between cell types, and 165 NPC-specific interactions that are absent in ES cells and acquired upon differentiation (Figure 2C). Thus, only cell-type-specific architectural features corresponding to the top 0.096% and 0.190% of all queried interactions in ES and NPC libraries, respectively, were considered for downstream analysis. We next integrated 5C data with other epigenomic data sets. We observed that a significant proportion of fragments engaged in 3D interactions were occupied by specific histone modifications. For example, a series of \u223c80- to 120-kb-sized looping interactions connect the Sox2 gene with a putative downstream enhancer in ES cells marked by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and low levels of H3K4me3 (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P.

Loss of enhancer marks in NPCs occured in parallel with loss of ES-specific looping interactions, suggesting that this particular chromatin conformation has important functional significance. Similarly, an ES-specific interaction connects the Pou5f1\/Oct4 gene to a putative enhancer \u223c25 kb upstream marked by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and low levels of H3K4me3 (Figure 2E). By contrast, we detected a hierarchy of constitutive interactions (constant between cell types) around the pluripotent genes Nanog and Slc2a3 despite changes in gene activity during differentiation (Figure 2F). These examples provide evidence that a notable proportion of looping interactions identified in this study may be involved in genome function. To gain more insight into organizing principles governing genome folding, we integrated 5C data with genome-wide maps of protein occupancy. We first examined factors that have been reported as both essential for cellular functions and correlated with a specific looping interactions using 3C technology. The top three candidates fulfilling these criteria were CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), cohesin, and Mediator (Hadjur et al., 2009Hadjur S. Williams L.M. Ryan N.K. Cobb B.S. Sexton T. Fraser P.

Genome-wide binding sites for CTCF, mediator subunit Med12, and cohesin subunit Smc1 have been previously identified in ES cells by ChIP-seq (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S.

Gaidatzis D. et al.DNA-binding factors shape the mouse methylome at distal regulatory regions.Nature. 2011; 480: 490-495PubMed Google Scholar). We first used the ChIP-seq data to quantify unique and overlapping occupied sites in our regions of interest. As previously reported, high-confidence Smc1 binding sites significantly overlapped high-confidence CTCF and Med12 binding sites (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). However, in addition to Med12+Smc1 and CTCF+Smc1 co-occupied sites, we also found notable subclasses of CTCF alone and Med12 alone both genome wide and in our regions of interest in ES cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). Noteworthy, Med12 rarely overlaps CTCF in the absence of cohesin, but a subclass with occupancy of all three proteins (i.e., Med12+Smc1+CTCF) does emerge as significant. We next examined the enrichment of CTCF, Med12, and Smc1 in 5C looping interactions. Unsupervised cluster analysis demonstrated that >80% of significant interactions were anchored by some combination of CTCF, Med12, or Smc1 in ES cells, which is significantly higher than the enrichment of these proteins in all queried background interactions (Figure 3C). By contrast, only \u223c40% of interactions were occupied by some combination of Oct4, Nanog, and\/or Sox2, which is not significant compared to the expected background enrichment of these proteins (Figure 3D). The widespread occupancy of CTCF, Med12, and Smc1 in 3D interactions led us to hypothesize that these three proteins might have important architectural roles in shaping 3D genome organization. We next explored the specific role for each candidate architectural protein subclass in genome organization. We observed a striking pattern in which multiple adjacent binding sites for the same architectural protein subclass were often found at the base of significant interactions. Indeed, enrichment for a particular architectural subclass in 3D interactions showed a strong correlation with the number of binding sites (Figure 3E). Therefore, to explore only high-confidence interactions, we focused our analysis on only loops anchored by >2 or >3 co-occupied sites (Figure 3F). CTCF+Smc1 and CTCF alone subclasses were highly overrepresented at the base of constitutive interactions compared to background nonloops (Figure 3F). By contrast, Med12+Smc1 and Med12 alone subclasses were predominantly enriched in only ES-specific looping interactions. Intriguingly, sites co-occupied by Med12+CTCF+Smc1 showed enrichment in both constitutive and ES-cell-specific interactions. We also noticed that interactions mediated by each candidate architectural subclass displayed markedly different size distributions (Figure 4A). Med12+Smc1 co-occupied sites were predominately enriched at the smallest <100 kb length scale (Figure 4B), whereas Med12 alone sites, independent from cohesin, were enriched at intermediate length scales of 600\u20131,000 kb (Figure 4D). The subclass with all three proteins (Med12+CTCF+Smc1) also displayed a loop size distribution shifted toward small to intermediate (<300 kb) length scales (Figure 4C). By contrast, loops connected by CTCF+Smc1 and CTCF Alone subclasses were significantly biased toward interactions greater than 1 Mb in size (Figures 4E and 4F). Together, these results support our hypothesis that architectural protein subclasses function at different length scales to fulfill distinct roles in genome organization. To further explore the molecular mechanisms regulating constitutive chromatin interactions, we mapped CTCF and Smc1 occupancy in NPCs using ChIP-seq. Genomic loci co-occupied by CTCF and Smc1 in both ES cells and NPCs represented the largest architectural subclass genome wide and in our regions of interest (n = 159) (Figures 5A and 5B ). Moreover, the sites with constant occupancy of CTCF+Smc1 between cell types were highly enriched in constitutive interactions compared to background (Figure 5C). This result is illustrated with a series of loops around Nanog and Slc2a3 (Figure 2F) and Olig1 and Olig2 (Figure 5D). At both genomic loci, fragments anchoring the base of const",

Integrated circuits formed on flexible plastic sheets can be lighter and tougher than those made from conventional materials, as well as being usefully bendy. Semiconductors made from organic small molecules and polymers have shown promise in such applications, but a new carbon-based nanomaterial described in this issue \u2014 its creators say \u2014 promises higher performance in electronic applications than the currently available options. Cao et al. have developed small- to medium-scale integrated digital circuits consisting of random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes on plastic substrates. The layouts enable both high mobilities and high on\/off ratios and the resulting devices and circuits (consisting of up to 100 transistors) show excellent electronic properties. These new films should be of use for a wide range of applications such as unusual consumer electronic devices, biological sensing and optoelectronics. The ability to form integrated circuits on flexible sheets of plastic enables attributes (for example conformal and flexible formats and lightweight and shock resistant construction) in electronic devices that are difficult or impossible to achieve with technologies that use semiconductor wafers or glass plates as substrates1. Organic small-molecule and polymer-based materials represent the most widely explored types of semiconductors for such flexible circuitry2. Although these materials and those that use films or nanostructures of inorganics have promise for certain applications, existing demonstrations of them in circuits on plastic indicate modest performance characteristics that might restrict the application possibilities. Here we report implementations of a comparatively high-performance carbon-based semiconductor consisting of sub-monolayer, random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes to yield small- to medium-scale integrated digital circuits, composed of up to nearly 100 transistors on plastic substrates. Transistors in these integrated circuits have excellent properties: mobilities as high as 80 cm2 V-1 s-1, subthreshold slopes as low as 140 m V dec-1, operating voltages less than 5 V together with deterministic control over the threshold voltages, on\/off ratios as high as 105, switching speeds in the kilohertz range even for coarse (\u223c100-\u03bcm) device geometries, and good mechanical flexibility\u2014all with levels of uniformity and reproducibility that enable high-yield fabrication of integrated circuits. Theoretical calculations, in contexts ranging from heterogeneous percolative transport through the networks to compact models for the transistors to circuit level simulations, provide quantitative and predictive understanding of these systems. Taken together, these results suggest that sub-monolayer films of single-walled carbon nanotubes are attractive materials for flexible integrated circuits, with many potential areas of application in consumer and other areas of electronics.",

Abstract A 10-year US Department of Energy-sponsored research program designed to evaluate and develop switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum ), a native perennial warm-season grass, as a dedicated energy crop is reviewed. The programmatic objectives were to identify the best varieties and management practices to optimize productivity, while developing an understanding of the basis for long-term improvement of switchgrass through breeding and sustainable production in conventional agroecosystems. This research has reduced the projected production cost of switchgrass by about 25% ($8\u20139\u00a0Mg \u22121 ) through yield increases of about 50% achieved through selection of the best regionally adapted varieties; through optimizing cutting frequency and timing; and by reducing the level (by about 40%) and timing of nitrogen fertilization. Breeding research has made further gains in productivity of switchgrass that exceed the historical rate of yield improvement of corn. Studies of soil carbon storage under switchgrass indicate significant carbon sequestration will occur in soils that will improve soil productivity and nutrient cycling and can substantially augment greenhouse gas reductions associated with substituting renewable energy for fossil energy. Collaborative research with industry has included fuel production and handling in power production, herbicide testing and licensing, release of new cultivars, and genetic modifications for chemical coproduct enhancement. Economically based life cycle analyses based on this research suggest that switchgrass produced for energy will compete favorably both as an agricultural crop and as fuel for industry.",

    "text":"Concise Review: MSC-Derived Exosomes for Cell-Free Therapy. Abstract Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is undergoing extensive evaluation as a cellular therapy in human clinical trials. Because MSCs are easily isolated and amenable to culture expansion in vitro there is a natural desire to test MSCs in many diverse clinical indications. This is exemplified by the rapidly expanding literature base that includes many in vivo animal models. More recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes and microvesicles (MV), are being examined for their role in MSC-based cellular therapy. These vesicles are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body. The exosomes and MVs can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease. MSC-derived exosomes have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. To the extent that MSC exosomes can be used for cell-free regenerative medicine, much will depend on the quality, reproducibility, and potency of their production, in the same manner that these parameters dictate the development of cell-based MSC therapies. However, the MSC exosome's contents are not static, but rather a product of the MSC tissue origin, its activities and the immediate intercellular neighbors of the MSCs. As such, the exosome content produced by MSCs appears to be altered when MSCs are cultured with tumor cells or in the in vivo tumor microenvironment. Therefore, careful attention to detail in producing MSC exosomes may provide a new therapeutic paradigm for cell-free MSC-based therapies with decreased risk.",

Radiation damage is the main problem which prevents the determination of the structure of a single biological macromolecule at atomic resolution using any kind of microscopy. This is true whether neutrons, electrons or X-rays are used as the illumination. For neutrons, the cross-section for nuclear capture and the associated energy deposition and radiation damage could be reduced by using samples that are fully deuterated and 15N-labelled and by using fast neutrons, but single molecule biological microscopy is still not feasible. For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.",

    "text":"Anthropogenic Chemical Carbon Cycle for a Sustainable Future. Nature\u2019s photosynthesis uses the sun\u2019s energy with chlorophyll in plants as a catalyst to recycle carbon dioxide and water into new plant life. Only given sufficient geological time, millions of years, can new fossil fuels be formed naturally. The burning of our diminishing fossil fuel reserves is accompanied by large anthropogenic CO2 release, which is outpacing nature\u2019s CO2 recycling capability, causing significant environmental harm. To supplement the natural carbon cycle, we have proposed and developed a feasible anthropogenic chemical recycling of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is captured by absorption technologies from any natural or industrial source, from human activities, or even from the air itself. It can then be converted by feasible chemical transformations into fuels such as methanol, dimethyl ether, and varied products including synthetic hydrocarbons and even proteins for animal feed, thus supplementing our food chain. This concept of broad scope and framework is the basis of what we call the Methanol Economy. The needed renewable starting materials, water and CO2, are available anywhere on Earth. The required energy for the synthetic carbon cycle can come from any alternative energy source such as solar, wind, geothermal, and even hopefully safe nuclear energy. The anthropogenic carbon dioxide cycle offers a way of assuring a sustainable future for humankind when fossil fuels become scarce. While biosources can play a limited role in supplementing future energy needs, they increasingly interfere with the essentials of the food chain. We have previously reviewed aspects of the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to methanol and dimethyl ether. In the present Perspective, we extend the discussion of the innovative and feasible anthropogenic carbon cycle, which can be the basis of progressively liberating humankind from its dependence on diminishing fossil fuel reserves while also controlling harmful CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. We also discuss in more detail the essential stages and the significant aspects of carbon capture and subsequent recycling. Our ability to develop a feasible anthropogenic chemical carbon cycle supplementing nature\u2019s photosynthesis also offers a new solution to one of the major challenges facing humankind.",

    "text":"Biophysical and Biochemical Sources of Variability in Canopy Reflectance. Analyses of various biophysical and biochemical factors affecting plant canopy reflectance have been carried out over the past few decades, yet the relative importance of these factors has not been adequately addressed. A combination of field and modeling techniques were used to quantify the relative contribution of leaf, stem, and litter optical properties (incorporating known variation in foliar biochemical properties) and canopy structural attributes to nadir-viewed vegetation reflectance data. Variability in tissue optical properties was wavelength-dependent. For green foliage, the lowest variation was in the visible (VIS) spectral region and the highest in the near-infrared (NIR). For standing litter material, minimum variation occurred in the VIS\/NIR, while the largest differences were observed in the shortwave-IR (SWIR). Woody stem material showed opposite trends, with lowest variation in the SWIR and highest in the NIR. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) were the dominant controls on canopy reflectance data with the exception of soil reflectance and vegetation cover in sparse canopies. Leaf optical properties (and thus foliar chemistry) were expressed most directly at the canopy level in the NIR, but LAI and LAD strongly controlled the relationship between leaf and canopy spectral characteristics. Stem material played a small but significant role in determining canopy reflectance in woody plant canopies, especially those with LAI<5.0. Standing litter significantly affected the reflectance characteristics of grassland canopies; small increases in the percentage of standing litter had a disproportionately large affect on canopy reflectance. The structural attributes of ecosystems determine the relative contribution of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive variation in a reflectance signal. Deconvolution of these factors requires an understanding of the sources of variance at each scale (which is ecosystem dependent) as well as an adequate sampling (spectral, angular, and temporal) of the shortwave (400\u20132500 nm) spectrum.",

Despite this fact, new antimicrotubule agents that possess unique mechanisms of cytotoxic action and have broader antineoplastic spectra than the vinca alkaloids have not been introduced over the last several decades\u2014until the recent development of taxol. Unlike classical antimicrotubule agents like colchicine and the vinca alkaloids, which induce depolymerization of microtubules, taxol induces tubulin polymerization and forms extremely stable and nonfunctional microtubules. Taxol has demonstrated broad activity in preclinical screening studies, and antineoplastic activity has been observed in several classically refractory tumors. These tumors include cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma in phase II trials and malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma in phase I studies. Taxol's structural complexity has hampered the development of feasible processes for synthesis, and its extreme scarcity has limited the use of a conventional, broad-scale screening approach for evaluation of clinical antitumor activity. However, taxol's unique mechanism of action, its spectrum of preclinical antitumor activity, and tumor responses in early clinical trials have generated renewed interest in pursuing its development.

Graphene hybridized ZnO photocatalyst showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic dye. The degree of photocatalytic activity enhancement strongly depended on the coverage of graphene on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles. The sample of 2\u00a0wt% graphene hybridized ZnO showed the highest photocatalytic activity, which was about 4 times as that of pristine ZnO. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the high migration efficiency of photo-induced electrons and the inhibited charge carriers recombination due to the electronic interaction between ZnO and graphene.

A new class of materials named metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has also been demonstrated to take up voluminous amounts of CO(2). However, these studies have been largely limited to equilibrium uptake measurements, which are a poor predictor of separation ability, rather than the more industrially relevant kinetic (dynamic) capacity. Here, we report that a known MOF, Mg-MOF-74, with open magnesium sites, rivals competitive materials in CO(2) capture, with 8.9 wt. % dynamic capacity, and undergoes facile CO(2) release at significantly lower temperature, 80 degrees C.

We identified over 300 MOFs with a predicted methane-storage capacity better than that of any known material, and this approach also revealed structure\u2013property relationships. Methyl-functionalized MOFs were frequently top performers, so we selected one such promising MOF and experimentally confirmed its predicted capacity. Chemists are able to prepare a wide variety of metal\u2013organic frameworks by connecting together inorganic and organic building blocks of all sorts of shapes and properties.

Activated derivatives of carboxylic acids have long served as versatile connection points in derivatizations and in the construction of carbon frameworks. In more recent years numerous catalytic transformations have been discovered which have made it possible for carboxylic acids to be used as building blocks without the need for additional activation steps. A large number of different product classes have become accessible from this single functionality along multifaceted reaction pathways. The frontispiece illustrates an important reason for this: In the catalytic cycles carbon monoxide gas can be released from acyl metal complexes, and gaseous carbon dioxide from carboxylate complexes, with different organometallic species being formed in each case. Thus, carboxylic acids can be used as synthetic equivalents of acyl, aryl, or alkyl halides, as well as organometallic reagents. This review provides an overview of interesting catalytic transformations of carboxylic acids and a number of derivatives accessible from them in situ.

The photocatalytic performance of the star photocatalyst g-C3N4 was restricted by the low efficiency because of the fast charge recombination. The present work developed a facile in situ method to construct g-C3N4\/g-C3N4 metal-free isotype heterojunction with molecular composite precursors with the aim to greatly promote the charge separation. Considering the fact that g-C3N4 samples prepared from urea and thiourea separately have different band structure, the molecular composite precursors of urea and thiourea were treated simultaneously under the same thermal conditions, in situ creating a novel layered g-C3N4\/g-C3N4 metal-free heterojunction (g-g CN heterojunction). This synthesis method is facile, economic, and environmentally benign using easily available earth-abundant green precursors. The confirmation of isotype g-g CN heterojunction was based on XRD, HRTEM, valence band XPS, ns-level PL, photocurrent, and EIS measurement. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 (thiourea) to g-C3N4 (urea) driven by the conduction band offset of 0.10 eV, whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from g-C3N4 (urea) to g-C3N4 (thiourea) driven by the valence band offset of 0.40 eV. The potential difference between the two g-C3N4 components in the heterojunction is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. For the removal of NO in air, the g-g CN heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity over g-C3N4 alone and physical mixture of g-C3N4 samples. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-g CN isotype heterojunction can be directly ascribed to efficient charge separation and transfer across the heterojunction interface as well as prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. This work demonstrated that rational design and construction of isotype heterojunction could open up a new avenue for the development of new efficient visible-light photocatalysts.",

    "text":"Anthropogenic sediment retention: major global impact from registered river impoundments. In this paper, we develop and apply a framework for estimating the potential global-scale impact of reservoir construction on riverine sediment transport to the ocean. Using this framework, we discern a large, global-scale, and growing impact from anthropogenic impoundment. Our study links information on 633 of the world's largest reservoirs (LRs) (\u22650.5 km3 maximum storage capacity) to the geography of continental discharge and uses statistical inferences to assess the potential impact of the remaining >44,000 smaller reservoirs (SRs). Information on the LRs was linked to a digitized river network at 30\u2032 (latitude\u00d7longitude) spatial resolution. A residence time change (\u0394\u03c4R) for otherwise free-flowing river water is determined locally for each reservoir and used with a sediment retention function to predict the proportion of incident sediment flux trapped within each impoundment. The discharge-weighted mean \u0394\u03c4R for individual impoundments distributed across the globe is 0.21 years for LRs and 0.011 years for SRs. More than 40% of global river discharge is intercepted locally by the LRs analyzed here, and a significant proportion (\u224870%) of this discharge maintains a theoretical sediment trapping efficiency in excess of 50%. Half of all discharge entering LRs shows a local sediment trapping efficiency of 80% or more. Analysis of the recent history of river impoundment reveals that between 1950 and 1968, there was tripling from 5% to 15% in global LR sediment trapping, another doubling to 30% by 1985, and stabilization thereafter. Several large basins such as the Colorado and Nile show nearly complete trapping due to large reservoir construction and flow diversion. From the standpoint of sediment retention rates, the most heavily regulated drainage basins reside in Europe. North America, Africa, and Australia\/Oceania are also strongly affected by LRs. Globally, greater than 50% of basin-scale sediment flux in regulated basins is potentially trapped in artificial impoundments, with a discharge-weighted sediment trapping due to LRs of 30%, and an additional contribution of 23% from SRs. If we consider both regulated and unregulated basins, the interception of global sediment flux by all registered reservoirs (n\u224845,000) is conservatively placed at 4\u20135 Gt year\u22121 or 25\u201330% of the total. There is an additional but unknown impact due to still smaller unregistered impoundments (n\u2248800,000). Our results demonstrate that river impoundment should now be considered explicitly in global elemental flux studies, such as for water, sediment, carbon, and nutrients. From a global change perspective, the long-term impact of such hydraulic engineering works on the world's coastal zone appears to be significant but has yet to be fully elucidated.",

We present a time series analysis of the MF of 186 countries and identify material flows associated with global production and consumption networks in unprecedented specificity. By calculating raw material equivalents of international trade, we demonstrate that countries' use of nondomestic resources is, on average, about threefold larger than the physical quantity of traded goods. As wealth grows, countries tend to reduce their domestic portion of materials extraction through international trade, whereas the overall mass of material consumption generally increases.

The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems is problematic.

Global mean temperature is predicted to increase by 2\u201371C and precipitation to change across the globe by the end of this century. To quantify climate effects on ecosystem processes, a number of climate change experiments have been established around the world in various ecosystems. Despite these efforts, general responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in temperature and precipitation, and especially to their combined effects, remain unclear. We used metaanalysis to synthesize ecosystem-level responses to warming, altered precipitation, and their combination. We focused on plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) balance, including biomass, net primary production (NPP), respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem photosynthesis, synthesizing results from 85 studies. We found that experimental warming and increased precipitation generally stimulated plant growth and ecosystem C fluxes, whereas decreased precipitation had the opposite effects. For example, warming significantly stimulated total NPP, increased ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration. Experimentally reduced precipitation suppressed aboveground NPP (ANPP) and NEE, whereas supplemental precipitation enhanced ANPP and NEE. Plant productivity and ecosystem C fluxes generally showed higher sensitivities to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation. Interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation tended to be smaller than expected from additive, single-factor effects, though low statistical power limits the strength of these conclusions. New experiments with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of temperature\u2013precipitation interactions on the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions.",

The global wetland area derived in this study is \u223c5.3 \u00d7 1012m2, approximately twice the wetland area previously used in methane-emission studies.

Growth-defense tradeoffs are thought to occur in plants due to resource restrictions, which demand prioritization towards either growth or defense, depending on external and internal factors. These tradeoffs have profound implications in agriculture and natural ecosystems, as both processes are vital for plant survival, reproduction, and, ultimately, plant fitness. While many of the molecular mechanisms underlying growth and defense tradeoffs remain to be elucidated, hormone crosstalk has emerged as a major player in regulating tradeoffs needed to achieve a balance. In this review, we cover recent advances in understanding growth-defense tradeoffs in plants as well as what is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we address evidence supporting the growth-defense tradeoff concept, as well as known interactions between defense signaling and growth signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of these tradeoffs in plants should provide a foundation for the development of breeding strategies that optimize the growth-defense balance to maximize crop yield to meet rising global food and biofuel demands.",

    "text":"Roots of the Second Green Revolution. The Green Revolution boosted crop yields in developing nations by introducing dwarf genotypes of wheat and rice capable of responding to fertilisation without lodging. We now need a second Green Revolution, to improve the yield of crops grown in infertile soils by farmers with little access to fertiliser, who represent the majority of third-world farmers. Just as the Green Revolution was based on crops responsive to high soil fertility, the second Green Revolution will be based on crops tolerant of low soil fertility. Substantial genetic variation in the productivity of crops in infertile soil has been known for over a century. In recent years we have developed a better understanding of the traits responsible for this variation. Root architecture is critically important by determining soil exploration and therefore nutrient acquisition. Architectural traits under genetic control include basal-root gravitropism, adventitious-root formation and lateral branching. Architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging are important for acquisition of phosphorus from infertile soils. Genetic variation in the length and density of root hairs is important for the acquisition of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Genetic variation in root cortical aerenchyma formation and secondary development (\u2018root etiolation\u2019) are important in reducing the metabolic costs of root growth and soil exploration. Genetic variation in rhizosphere modification through the efflux of protons, organic acids and enzymes is important for the mobilisation of nutrients such as phosphorus and transition metals, and the avoidance of aluminum toxicity. Manipulation of ion transporters may be useful for improving the acquisition of nitrate and for enhancing salt tolerance. With the noteworthy exceptions of rhizosphere modification and ion transporters, most of these traits are under complex genetic control. Genetic variation in these traits is associated with substantial yield gains in low-fertility soils, as illustrated by the case of phosphorus efficiency in bean and soybean. In breeding crops for low-fertility soils, selection for specific root traits through direct phenotypic evaluation or molecular markers is likely to be more productive than conventional field screening. Crop genotypes with greater yield in infertile soils will substantially improve the productivity and sustainability of low-input agroecosystems, and in high-input agroecosystems will reduce the environmental impacts of intensive fertilisation. Although the development of crops with reduced fertiliser requirements has been successful in the few cases it has been attempted, the global scientific effort devoted to this enterprise is small, especially considering the magnitude of the humanitarian, environmental and economic benefits being forgone. Population growth, ongoing soil degradation and increasing costs of chemical fertiliser will make the second Green Revolution a priority for plant biology in the 21st century.",

Abstract The second largest zone of coastal hypoxia (oxygen-depleted waters) in the world is found on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf adjacent to the outflows of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The combination of high freshwater discharge, wind mixing, regional circulation, and summer warming controls the strength of stratification that goes through a well-defined seasonal cycle. The physical structure of the water column and high nutrient loads that enhance primary production lead to an annual formation of the hypoxic water mass that is dominant from spring through late summer. Paleoindicators in dated sediment cores indicate that hypoxic conditions likely began to appear around the turn of the last century and became more severe since the 1950s as the nitrate flux from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico tripled. Whereas increased nutrients enhance the production of some organisms, others are eliminated from water masses (they either emigrate from the area or die) where the oxygen level falls below 2 mg l \u22121 or lower for a prolonged period. A hypoxia-stressed benthos is typified by short-lived, smaller surface deposit-feeding polychaetes and the absence of marine invertebrates such as pericaridean crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, and ophiuroids. The changes in benthic communities, along with the low dissolved oxygen, result in altered sediment structure and sediment biogeochemical cycles. Important fisheries are variably affected by increased or decreased food supplies, mortality, forced migration, reduction in suitable habitat, increased susceptibility to predation, and disruption of life cycles.",

We present a critical review of the relationships among three microbial products: extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), soluble microbial products (SMP), and inert biomass. Up to now, two different \"schools\" of researchers have treated these products separately. The \"EPS school\" has considered active biomass and EPS, while the \"SMP school\" has considered active biomass, SMP, and inert biomass. Here, we provide a critical review of each of the microbial products. Then, we develop a unified theory that couples them and reconciles apparent contradictions. In our unified theory, cells use electrons from the electron-donor substrate to build active biomass, and they also produce bound EPS and utilization-associated products (UAP) at the same time and in proportion to substrate utilization. Bound EPS are hydrolyzed to biomass-associated products (BAP), while active biomass undergoes endogenous decay to form residual dead cells. Finally, UAP and BAP, being biodegradable, are utilized by active biomass as recycled electron-donors substrates. Our unified theory shows that the apparently distinct products from the SMP and EPS schools overlap each other. Soluble EPS is actually SMP, or the sum of UAP and BAP. Furthermore, active biomass, as defined by the SMP school, includes bound EPS, while inert biomass includes bound EPS and the residual dead cells.",

    "text":"Global fire emissions estimates during 1997\u20132016. Abstract. Climate, land use, and other anthropogenic and natural drivers have the potential to influence fire dynamics in many regions. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the changing role of these drivers and their impact on atmospheric composition, long-term fire records are needed that fuse information from different satellite and in situ data streams. Here we describe the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and quantify global fire emissions patterns during 1997\u20132016. The modeling system, based on the Carnegie\u2013Ames\u2013Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, has several modifications from the previous version and uses higher quality input datasets. Significant upgrades include (1) new burned area estimates with contributions from small fires, (2) a revised fuel consumption parameterization optimized using field observations, (3) modifications that improve the representation of fuel consumption in frequently burning landscapes, and (4) fire severity estimates that better represent continental differences in burning processes across boreal regions of North America and Eurasia. The new version has a higher spatial resolution (0.25\u00b0) and uses a different set of emission factors that separately resolves trace gas and aerosol emissions from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Global mean carbon emissions using the burned area dataset with small fires (GFED4s) were 2.2 \u00d7 1015 grams of carbon per year (Pg C yr\u22121) during 1997\u20132016, with a maximum in 1997 (3.0 Pg C yr\u22121) and minimum in 2013 (1.8 Pg C yr\u22121). These estimates were 11 % higher than our previous estimates (GFED3) during 1997\u20132011, when the two datasets overlapped. This net increase was the result of a substantial increase in burned area (37 %), mostly due to the inclusion of small fires, and a modest decrease in mean fuel consumption (\u221219 %) to better match estimates from field studies, primarily in savannas and grasslands. For trace gas and aerosol emissions, differences between GFED4s and GFED3 were often larger due to the use of revised emission factors. If small fire burned area was excluded (GFED4 without the s for small fires), average emissions were 1.5 Pg C yr\u22121. The addition of small fires had the largest impact on emissions in temperate North America, Central America, Europe, and temperate Asia. This small fire layer carries substantial uncertainties; improving these estimates will require use of new burned area products derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. Our revised dataset provides an internally consistent set of burned area and emissions that may contribute to a better understanding of multi-decadal changes in fire dynamics and their impact on the Earth system.

Drawing on the wealth of case studies in this Special Issue, we synthesize the information presented, according to case characteristics with respect to design, costs, environmental effectiveness, and other outcomes. PES programs often differ substantially one from the other. Some of the differences reflect adaptation of the basic concept to very different ecological, socioeconomic, or institutional conditions; others reflect poor design, due either to mistakes or to the need to accommodate political pressures. We find significant differences between user-financed PES programs, in which funding comes from the users of the ES being provided, and government-financed programs, in which funding comes from a third party. The user-financed programs in our sample were better targeted, more closely tailored to local conditions and needs, had better monitoring and a greater willingness to enforce conditionality, and had far fewer confounding side objectives than government-financed programs.

We demonstrate the electroblotting analyses of protein phosphorylation status by the phosphate-selective ECL signals. Another method is based on the mobility shift of phosphorylated proteins in SDS-PAGE with polyacrylamide-bound Mn2+-Phos-tag. Phosphorylated proteins in the gel are visualized as slower migration bands compared with corresponding dephosphorylated proteins. We demonstrate the kinase and phosphatase assays by phosphate affinity electrophoresis (Mn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE). We introduce two methods for the visualization of phosphorylated proteins using alkoxide-bridged dinuclear metal (i.e. Zn2+ or Mn2+) complexes as novel phosphate-binding tag (Phos-tag) molecules.

Phosphorylation is a fundamental covalent post-translational modification that regulates the function, localization, and binding specificity of target proteins (1Hunter T. Protein kinases and phosphatases: the yin and yang of protein phosphorylation and signaling.Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Signaling\u20142000 and beyond.Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Organisms utilize this reversible reaction of proteins to control many cellular activities, including signal transduction, apoptosis, gene expression, cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal regulation, and energy metabolism. Abnormal protein phosphorylations are deeply related to carcinogenesis and neuropathogenesis. Methods for determining the phosphorylation status of proteins are thus very important with respect to the evaluation of diverse biological and pathological processes. Recently we have reported that a dinuclear metal complex (i.e. 1,3-bis[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]propan-2-olato dizinc(II) complex) acts as a novel phosphate-binding tag (Phos-tag) 1The abbreviations used are: Phos-tag, phosphate-binding tag; AP, alkaline phosphatase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HRP-SA, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; TC-PTP, T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; TEMED, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; pMBP, phospho-MBP; HL, metal-free ligand; ADBI, assay dilution buffer I; 2-D, two-dimensional. 1The abbreviations used are: Phos-tag, phosphate-binding tag; AP, alkaline phosphatase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HRP-SA, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; TC-PTP, T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; TEMED, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; pMBP, phospho-MBP; HL, metal-free ligand; ADBI, assay dilution buffer I; 2-D, two-dimensional.

A431 cell lysate solved in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was desalted using Microcon YM3 filter units and resolved in a sample buffer for IEF (9.5 m urea, 2% (w\/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (w\/v) Ampholine, and 5% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) to become 2.5 \u03bcg of protein\/\u03bcl. An IEF disc gel (2-mm diameter and 12 cm long) consisted of 9.2 m urea, 4% (w\/v) acrylamide, 0.2% (w\/v) N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide, 0.1% (v\/v) TEMED, 1.5% (w\/v) Nonidet P-40, 2% (w\/v) Ampholine, and 0.015% (w\/v) ammonium persulfate. IEF was performed using Atto SJ-1060DCII. The electrode buffer of positive pole (11 mm H3PO4, 0.75 liter) was poured into the lower chamber, and the disc gels were set. Sample solutions (50 \u03bcg of protein\/20 \u03bcl) were applied, 20 \u03bcl of a sample protection buffer (4.5 m urea and 1% (w\/v) Ampholine) was put on the sample layer, and electrode buffer of negative pole (25 mm NaOH, 450 ml) was poured into the upper chamber. IEF was carried out at 400 V for 16 h at room temperature without cooling. After IEF electrophoresis, a disc gel was soaked twice for 15 min with a 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 2.5% (w\/v) SDS, 5% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (w\/v) glycerol. And then SDS-PAGE (12.5% (w\/v) polyacrylamide) was performed at 50 mA\/gel at room temperature using a 1-mm-thick, 13.5-cm-wide, and 13.5-cm-long gel (model AE-6200, Atto). The separated proteins in a polyacrylamide gel were electroblotted to PVDF membranes for 2 h using a semidry blotting system (Nippon Eido NB-1600, Tokyo, Japan) at 2 mA\/cm2 with three kinds of blotting solutions (solutions A, B, and C). After normal SDS-PAGE, the gel was soaked in solution B (25 mm Tris and 5% (v\/v) MeOH) for 10 min. After Mn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, the gel was soaked in solution B containing 1.0 mm EDTA for 10 min and then soaked in solution B for 10 min. Three No. 3MM papers were soaked in solution A (25 mm Tris, 40 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 5% (v\/v) MeOH) and piled on the negative pole board. The gel, the PVDF membrane, and a piece of No. 3MM paper were soaked in solution B and piled up in order. Then two pieces of No. 3MM paper soaked in solution C (0.30 m Tris and 5% (v\/v) MeOH) were piled up. Finally they were covered with the positive pole board, and electricity was supplied.

Time-dependent phosphorylations of substrates were performed as follows. In the case of phosphorylation of Abltide-GST, 0.14 ml of ADBI, 39 \u03bcl of magnesium\/ATP mixture, 20 \u03bcl of Abltide-GST (20 \u03bcg), and 1.0 \u03bcl of recombinant Abl (0.1 \u03bcg) were incubated at 30 \u00b0C.

The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by addition of a half-volume of 3\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Zero time samples were prepared using the same components without the enzymes. Dephosphorylated samples of phosphoproteins were prepared using a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0, 0.20 ml) containing 1.0 mm MgCl2, 50 \u03bcg of protein, and 3.3 units of alkaline phosphatase (incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h and then mixing with 0.10 ml of 3\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer). Time-dependent dephosphorylation of bovine milk \u03b2-casein was performed in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0, 0.14 ml) containing 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mg of protein, and 165 microunits of alkaline phosphatase at 37 \u00b0C. Phosphorylated Abltide-GST was prepared as mentioned above, and the solution of the kinase reaction was used in the tyrosine phosphatase assay. Time-dependent dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Abltide-GST was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 0.20 ml) containing 20 \u03bcl of phosphorylated Abltide-GST (2 \u03bcg) solution, and 0.3 unit of TC-PTP at 30 \u00b0C. The dephosphorylation reactions were stopped by addition of a half-volume of 3\u00d7 SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Zero time samples were prepared using the same components without the enzymes. To visualize phosphorylated proteins, we determined the potency of biotin-pendant Zn2+-Phos-tag (9Inamori K. Kyo M. Nishiya Y. Inoue Y. Sonoda T. Kinoshita E. Koike T. Katayama Y.

Chem. 2005; 77: 3979-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) as a phosphate-binding biotin derivative for Western blotting analysis. As the first example, phosphorylated proteins (i.e. \u03b1-casein, \u03b2-casein, ovalbumin, and pepsin) spotted on a PVDF membrane were specifically detected at nanogram levels using an ECL system and a 4:1 complex of biotin-pendant Zn2+-Phos-tag and HRP-SA without a blocking treatment of the membrane. A typical ECL image by dot-blotting analysis is shown in Fig. 2a. No ECL signal was detected on the spots of the corresponding dephosphorylated proteins and the nonphosphorylated proteins (i.e. bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, and \u03b2-galactosidase). In the absence of the zinc(II) ions (i.e. using a 4:1 complex of biotin-pendant Phos-tag ligand and HRP-SA in the presence of 1 mm EDTA), no ECL signals were detected on the spots of phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). Thus, the phosphate-selective ECL signals were produced by the complex of biotin-pendant Zn2+-Phos-tag and HRP-SA via the interaction between the zinc(II) ions and the phosphomonoester dianion. Next we applied the complex of biotin-pendant Zn2+-Phos-tag and HRP-SA to an electroblotting analysis after SDS-PAGE. This application did not require a blocking treatment of a PVDF membrane. The phosphorylation of Abltide-GST incubated with a tyrosine kinase, Abl, and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Abltide-GST incubated with a tyrosine phosphatase, TC-PTP, were visualized on PVDF membranes. The Abltide-GST is a recombinant fusion protein of an Abl substrate peptide (Abltide, Glu-Ala-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys) tagged by a GST. The Tyr 4 residue (italicized) of the Abltide section is selectively phosphorylated by Abl. The time courses of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are shown in Fig. 2, b and c, respectively. Both ECL detections were successively confirmed by a conventional procedure, immunoprobing with the anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody (clone PY20) of the same blots. We also demonstrated similar electroblotting analyses of the phosphorylation of MAP kinase (phosphorylated on the Thr 183 and Tyr 185 residues) incubated with MEK1 (a Tyr and Ser\/Thr dual kinase) and the phosphorylation of histone H1.2 incubated with protein kinase A (a Ser\/Thr kinase) (Supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicate that biotin-pendant Zn2+-Phos-tag captures various phosphorylated proteins bound on a PVDF membrane. We extended the phosphate-specific detection to the analysis of",

Moreover, the rapid development of power electronics technologies has even realized high energy-efficient vehicles. EV could be the alternative to decrease the global green house gases emission as the energy consumption in the world transportation is high. However, EV faces huge challenges in battery cost since one-third of the EV cost lies on battery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art of the energy sources, storage devices, power converters, low-level control energy management strategies and high supervisor control algorithms used in EV. The comparison on advantages and disadvantages of vehicle technology is highlighted. In addition, the standards and patterns of drive cycles for EV are also outlined. The advancement of power electronics and power processors has enabled sophisticated controls (low-level and high supervisory algorithms) to be implemented in EV to achieve optimum performance as well as the realization of fast-charging stations. The rapid growth of EV has led to the integration of alternative resources to the utility grid and hence smart grid control plays an important role in managing the demand. The awareness of environmental issue and fuel crisis has brought up the sales of EV worldwide.",

To discover potential molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of metazoan multicellularity, we sequenced and analysed the genome of the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. The genome contains approximately 9,200 intron-rich genes, including a number that encode cell adhesion and signalling protein domains that are otherwise restricted to metazoans. Here we show that the physical linkages among protein domains often differ between M. brevicollis and metazoans, suggesting that abundant domain shuffling followed the separation of the choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. The completion of the M. brevicollis genome allows us to reconstruct with increasing resolution the genomic changes that accompanied the origin of metazoans. The genome sequence of the marine choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis has now been determined. Choanoflagellates are a mainly sessile group of protozoa resembling the 'feeding cells' of sponges, and are considered to be the closest living unicellular relatives of multicellular animals. Comparison of the M. brevicollis sequence with metazoan genomes suggests that the last unicellular ancestor of animals had intron-rich genes, some encoding protein domains characteristically associated with cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix in animals. This organism is strictly unicellular, but other choanoflagellates form colonies and may provide clues as to the origin of cell signalling and other systems in early metazoans.",

    "text":"Discovery and Development of Folic-Acid-Based Receptor Targeting for Imaging and Therapy of Cancer and Inflammatory Diseases. In order to avoid the toxicities associated with prescription drug use today, we have explored novel methods for delivering drugs selectively to pathologic cells, thereby avoiding the collateral damage that accompanies their uptake by healthy cells. In this Account, we describe our quest for the ideal targeted therapeutic agent. This effort began with a search for ligands that would bind selectively to pathologic cells, displaying no affinity for healthy cells. After identification of an optimal targeting ligand, effort was focused on construction of linkers that would carry the attached drug to pathologic cells with receptors for the selected ligand. In the case of cancer, we exploited the well-characterized up-regulation of folate receptors on malignant cells to target folate-linked pharmaceuticals to cancer tissues in vivo. Drugs that have been linked to folic acid for tumor-selective drug delivery to date include (i) protein toxins, (ii) chemotherapeutic agents, (iii) gene therapy vectors, (iv) oligonucleotides (including small interfering RNA (siRNA)), (v) radioimaging agents, (vi) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, (vii) liposomes with entrapped drugs, (viii) radiotherapeutic agents, (ix) immunotherapeutic agents, and (x) enzyme constructs for prodrug therapy. Current clinical trials of four folate-linked drugs demonstrate that folate receptor-targeting holds great promise for increasing the potency while reducing toxicity of many cancer therapies. In the course of developing folate-conjugated drugs for cancer, we discovered that folate receptors are also overexpressed on activated (but not resting or quiescent) macrophages. Recognizing that activated macrophages either cause or contribute to such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, lupus, inflammatory osteoarthritis, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury, glomerulonephritis, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, Sjogren's disease, and vasculitis, we initiated studies aimed at developing folate-conjugated imaging and therapeutic agents for the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases. In very brief time, significant progress has been made towards identification of clinical candidates for targeted treatment of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This Account summarizes the discovery and development of a variety of folate-targeted drugs for the diagnosis and therapy of cancers and inflammatory\/autoimmune diseases.",

The electrochemical determination of glucose concentration without using enzyme is one of the dreams that many researchers have been trying to make come true. As new materials have been reported and more knowledge on detailed mechanism of glucose oxidation has been unveiled, the non-enzymatic glucose sensor keeps coming closer to practical applications. Recent reports strongly imply that this progress will be accelerated in 'nanoera'. This article reviews the history of unraveling the mechanism of direct electrochemical oxidation of glucose and making attempts to develop successful electrochemical glucose sensors. The electrochemical oxidation of glucose molecules involves complex processes of adsorption, electron transfer, and subsequent chemical rearrangement, which are combined with the surface reactions on the metal surfaces. The information about the direct oxidation of glucose on solid-state surfaces as well as new electrode materials will lead us to possible breakthroughs in designing the enzymeless glucose sensing devices that realize innovative and powerful detection. An example of those is to introduce nanoporous platinum as an electrode, on which glucose is oxidized electrochemically with remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. Better model of such glucose sensors is sought by summarizing and revisiting the previous reports on the electrochemistry of glucose itself and new electrode materials.",

    "text":"Modification of the response of photosynthetic productivity to rising temperature by atmospheric CO2 concentrations: Has its importance been underestimated?. Abstract. Climate change will include correlated increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca). Rising temperatures will increase the ratio of photorespiratory loss of carbon to photosynthetic gain, whilst rising Ca will have an opposing effect. The mechanism of these effects at the level of carboxylation in C3 photosynthesis are quantitatively well understood and provide a basis for models of the response of leaf and canopy carbon exchange to climate change. The principles of such a model are referred to here and used to quantitatively examine the implications of concurrent increase in temperature and Ca. Simulations of leaf photosynthesis show the increase, with elevation of Ca from 350 to 650 \u03bcmol mol-1, in light saturated rates of CO2 uptake (Asat) and maximum quantum yields (\u03c6) to rise with temperature. An increase in Ca from 350 to 650 \u03bcmol mol-1 can increase Asat by 20% at 10\u00b0C and by 105% at 35\u00b0C, and can raise the temperature optimum of Asat by 5\u00b0C. This pattern of change agrees closely with experimental data. At the canopy level, simulations also suggest a strong interaction of increased temperature and CO2 concentration. Predictions are compared with the findings of long-term field studies. The principles used here suggest that elevated Ca will alter both the magnitude of the response of leaf and canopy carbon gain to rising temperature, and sometimes, the direction of response. Findings question the value of models for predicting plant production in response to climate change which ignore the direct effects of rising Ca and the modifications that rising Ca imposes on the temperature response of net CO2 exchange.",

All previous energy analyses have been based on data from research plots (&lt;5 m 2 ) and estimated inputs. We managed switchgrass as a biomass energy crop in field trials of 3\u20139 ha (1 ha = 10,000 m 2 ) on marginal cropland on 10 farms across a wide precipitation and temperature gradient in the midcontinental U.S. to determine net energy and economic costs based on known farm inputs and harvested yields. In this report, we summarize the agricultural energy input costs, biomass yield, estimated ethanol output, greenhouse gas emissions, and net energy results. Annual biomass yields of established fields averaged 5.2 -11.1 Mg\u00b7ha \u22121 with a resulting average estimated net energy yield (NEY) of 60 GJ\u00b7ha \u22121 \u00b7y \u22121 . Switchgrass produced 540% more renewable than nonrenewable energy consumed. Switchgrass monocultures managed for high yield produced 93% more biomass yield and an equivalent estimated NEY than previous estimates from human-made prairies that received low agricultural inputs. Estimated average greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cellulosic ethanol derived from switchgrass were 94% lower than estimated GHG from gasoline. This is a baseline study that represents the genetic material and agronomic technology available for switchgrass production in 2000 and 2001, when the fields were planted. Improved genetics and agronomics may further enhance energy sustainability and biofuel yield of switchgrass.",

Smoking cessation treatment is now integrated into many health-care systems and a major research effort is under way to improve current success rates. Until now results from randomized clinical trials have been reported in many different ways, leading to problems of interpretation. We propose six standard criteria comprising the \u2018Russell Standard\u2019 (RS). These criteria are applicable to trials of cessation aids where participants have a defined target quit date and there is face-to-face contact with researchers or clinic staff, as follows. (1) Follow-up for 6 months (RS6) or 12 months (RS12) from the target quit date or the end of a predefined \u2018grace period\u2019; (2) self-report of smoking abstinence over the whole follow-up period allowing up to five cigarettes in total; (3) biochemical verification of abstinence at least at the 6-month or 12-month follow-up point; (4) use of an \u2018intention-to-treat\u2019 approach in which data from all randomized smokers are included in the analysis unless they have died or moved to an untraceable address (participants who are included in the analysis are counted as smokers if their smoking status at the final follow-up cannot be determined); (5) following-up \u2018protocol violators\u2019 and using their true smoking status in the analysis; and (6) collecting follow-up data blind to smokers\u2019 allocation to trial group. We believe that these criteria provide the best compromise between practicability and surrogacy for long-term cessation and will enable meaningful comparison between studies. There may be good reasons why other outcome criteria would also be reported, and studies that involve interventions with special groups or where there is no designated target quit date or face to face contact would need to adapt these criteria accordingly.",

Here, we use the largest dataset of microplastic measurements assembled to date to assess the confidence we can have in global estimates of microplastic abundance and mass.

The utility of our devices was then demonstrated with the determination of glucose, lactate, and uric acid in biological samples using oxidase enzyme (glucose oxidase, lactate oxidase, and uricase, respectively) reactions. Oxidase enzyme reactions produce H2O2 while decomposing their respective substrates, and therefore a single electrode type is needed for detection of multiple species. Selectivity of the working electrode for H2O2 was improved using Prussian Blue as a redox mediator. The determination of glucose, lactate, and uric acid in control serum samples was performed using chronoamperometry at the optimal detection potential for H2O2 (0 V versus the on-chip Ag\/AgCl reference electrode). Levels of glucose and lactate in control serum samples measured using the paper devices were 4.9 \u00b1 0.6 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 mM (level I control sample), and 16.3 \u00b1 0.7 and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 mM (level II control sample), respectively, and were within error of the values measured using traditional tests.

Here, across a scale of 400,000 km2, we report that tree species richness in production forests shows positive to positively hump-shaped relationships with multiple ecosystem services. These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50% greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of production forests will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain the full range of benefits that the society obtains from forests. Tree diversity is thought to benefit forest ecosystems, but evidence from large-scale studies is scarce. This study of a 400,000 km2forest area shows that higher tree species richness supports higher levels of multiple ecosystem services, and therefore also a more sustainable management of production forests.",

    "text":"Colony Collapse Disorder: A Descriptive Study. Over the last two winters, there have been large-scale, unexplained losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in the United States. In the absence of a known cause, this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted.",

Carbon-based nanomaterials have been widely used as catalysts or catalyst supports in the chemical industry or for energy or environmental applications due to their fascinating properties. High surface areas, tunable porosity, and functionalization are considered to be crucial to enhance the catalytic performance of carbon-based materials. Recently, the newly emerging metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) built from metal ions and polyfunctional organic ligands have proved to be promising self-sacrificing templates and precursors for preparing various carbon-based nanomaterials, benefiting from their high BET surface areas, abundant metal\/organic species, large pore volumes, and extraordinary tunability of structures and compositions. In comparison with other carbon-based catalysts, MOF-derived carbon-based nanomaterials have great advantages in terms of tailorable morphologies and hierarchical porosity and easy functionalization with other heteroatoms and metal\/metal oxides, which make them highly efficient as...",

    "text":"Zinc-blende\u2013wurtzite polytypism in semiconductors. The zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (W) structures are the most common crystal forms of binary octet semiconductors. In this work we have developed a simple scaling that systematizes the T=0 energy difference \\ensuremath{\\Delta}${\\mathit{E}}_{\\mathrm{W}\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}\\mathrm{ZB}}$ between W and ZB for all simple binary semiconductors. We have first calculated the energy difference \\ensuremath{\\Delta}${\\mathit{E}}_{\\mathrm{W}\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}\\mathrm{ZB}}^{\\mathrm{LDF}}$(AB) for AlN, GaN, InN, AlP, AlAs, GaP, GaAs, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, C, and Si using a numerically precise implementation of the first-principles local-density formalism (LDF), including structural relaxations. We then find a linear scaling between \\ensuremath{\\Delta}${\\mathit{E}}_{\\mathrm{W}\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}\\mathrm{ZB}}^{\\mathrm{LDF}}$(AB) and an atomistic orbital-radii coordinate R\\ifmmode \\tilde{}\\else \\~{}\\fi{}(A,B) that depends only on the properties of the free atoms A and B making up the binary compound AB. Unlike classical structural coordinates (electronegativity, atomic sizes, electron count), R\\ifmmode \\tilde{}\\else \\~{}\\fi{} is an orbital-dependent quantity; it is calculated from atomic pseudopotentials. The good linear fit found between \\ensuremath{\\Delta}${\\mathit{E}}_{\\mathrm{W}\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}\\mathrm{ZB}}$ and R\\ifmmode \\tilde{}\\else \\~{}\\fi{} (rms error of \\ensuremath{\\sim}3 meV\/atom) permits predictions of the W-ZB energy difference for many more AB compounds than the 13 used in establishing this fit. We use this model to identify chemical trends in \\ensuremath{\\Delta}${\\mathit{E}}_{\\mathrm{W}\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}\\mathrm{ZB}}$ in the IV-IV, III-V, II-VI, and I-VII octet compounds as either the anion or the cation are varied. We further find that the ground state of MgTe is the NiAs structure and that CdSe and HgSe are stable in the ZB form. These compounds were previously thought to be stable in the W structures.",

    "text":"B\u2013N compounds for chemical hydrogenstorage. Hydrogen storage for transportation applications requires high volumetric and gravimetric storage capacity. B-N compounds are well suited as storage materials due to their light weight and propensity for bearing multiple protic (N-H) and hydridic (B-H) hydrogens. This critical review briefly covers the various methods of hydrogen storage, and then concentrates on chemical hydrogen storage using B-N compounds. The simplest B-N compound, ammonia borane (H3NBH3), which has a potential 19.6 wt% hydrogen storage capacity, will be emphasised (127 references).",

Fat grafting remains shrouded in the stigma of variable results experienced by most plastic surgeons when they first graft fat. However, many who originally reported failure eventually report success after altering their methods of harvesting, refinement, and placement. Many surgeons have refined their techniques to obtain long-term survival and volume replacement with grafted fat. They have observed that transplanted fat not only adjusts facial and body proportion but also improves surrounding tissues into which the fat is placed. They have noted not only the improvement in the quality of aging skin and scars but also a remarkable improvement in conditions such as radiation damage, chronic ulceration, breast capsular contracture, and damaged vocal cords. The mechanism of fat graft survival is not clear, and the role of adipose-derived stem cells and preadipocytes in fat survival remains to be determined. Early research has indicated the possible involvement of more undifferentiated cells in some of the observed effects of fat grafting on surrounding tissues. Of particular interest is the research that has pointed to the use of stem cells to repair and even to become bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, nerves, and skin.

However, little is known about the effects of these nanomaterials on biological systems. Here we show that the shape of these materials is directly related to their induced cellular toxicity. Both G and SWCNT induce cytotoxic effects, and these effects are concentration- and shape-dependent. Interestingly, at low concentrations, G induced stronger metabolic activity than SWCNT, a trend that reversed at higher concentrations. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were found to be significantly higher for SWCNT as compared to the G samples. Moreover, reactive oxygen species were generated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after exposure to G, indicating an oxidative stress mechanism. Furthermore, time-dependent caspase 3 activation after exposure to G (10 microg\/mL) shows evidence of apoptosis. Altogether these studies suggest different biological activities of the graphitic nanomaterials, with the shape playing a primary role.",

New sustainable methods are needed to produce renewable energy carriers that can be stored and used for transportation, heating, or chemical production. Here we demonstrate that methane can directly be produced using a biocathode containing methanogens in electrochemical systems (abiotic anode) or microbial electrolysis cells (MECs; biotic anode) by a process called electromethanogenesis. At a set potential of less than \u22120.7 V (vs Ag\/AgCl), carbon dioxide was reduced to methane using a two-chamber electrochemical reactor containing an abiotic anode, a biocathode, and no precious metal catalysts. At \u22121.0 V, the current capture efficiency was 96%. Electrochemical measurements made using linear sweep voltammetry showed that the biocathode substantially increased current densities compared to a plain carbon cathode where only small amounts of hydrogen gas could be produced. Both increased current densities and very small hydrogen production rates by a plain cathode therefore support a mechanism of methane production directly from current and not from hydrogen gas. The biocathode was dominated by a single Archaeon, Methanobacterium palustre. When a current was generated by an exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode growing on acetate in a single-chamber MEC, methane was produced at an overall energy efficiency of 80% (electrical energy and substrate heat of combustion). These results show that electromethanogenesis can be used to convert electrical current produced from renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar, or biomass) into a biofuel (methane) as well as serving as a method for the capture of carbon dioxide.",

Air pollution is a serious public health problem throughout the world, especially in industrialized and developing countries. In industrialized and developing countries, motor vehicle emissions are major contributors to urban air quality. Hydrogen is one of the clean fuel options for reducing motor vehicle emissions. Hydrogen is not an energy source. It is not a primary energy existing freely in nature. Hydrogen is a secondary form of energy that has to be manufactured like electricity. It is an energy carrier. Hydrogen has a strategic importance in the pursuit of a low-emission, environment-benign, cleaner and more sustainable energy system. Combustion product of hydrogen is clean, which consists of water and a little amount of nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen has very special properties as a transportation fuel, including a rapid burning speed, a high effective octane number, and no toxicity or ozone-forming potential. It has much wider limits of flammability in air than methane and gasoline. Hydrogen has become the dominant transport fuel, and is produced centrally from a mixture of clean coal and fossil fuels (with C-sequestration), nuclear power, and large-scale renewables. Large-scale hydrogen production is probable on the longer time scale. In the current and medium term the production options for hydrogen are first based on distributed hydrogen production from electrolysis of water and reforming of natural gas and coal. Each of centralized hydrogen production methods scenarios could produce 40 million tons per year of hydrogen. Hydrogen production using steam reforming of methane is the most economical method among the current commercial processes. In this method, natural gas feedstock costs generally contribute approximately 52\u201368% to the final hydrogen price for larger plants, and 40% for smaller plants, with remaining expenses composed of capital charges. The hydrogen production cost from natural gas via steam reforming of methane varies from about 1.25 US$\/kg for large systems to about 3.50 US$\/kg for small systems with a natural gas price of 6 US$\/GJ.

Some theories and experimental studies suggest that areas of low plant species richness may be invaded more easily than areas of high plant species richness. We gathered nested-scale vegetation data on plant species richness, foliar cover, and frequency from 200 1-m2 subplots (20 1000-m2 modified-Whittaker plots) in the Colorado Rockies (USA), and 160 1-m2 subplots (16 1000-m2 plots) in the Central Grasslands in Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota (USA) to test the generality of this paradigm. At the 1-m2 scale, the paradigm was supported in four prairie types in the Central Grasslands, where exotic species richness declined with increasing plant species richness and cover. At the 1-m2 scale, five forest and meadow vegetation types in the Colorado Rockies contradicted the paradigm; exotic species richness increased with native-plant species richness and foliar cover. At the 1000-m2 plot scale (among vegetation types), 83% of the variance in exotic species richness in the Central Grasslands was explained by the total percentage of nitrogen in the soil and the cover of native plant species. In the Colorado Rockies, 69% of the variance in exotic species richness in 1000-m2 plots was explained by the number of native plant species and the total percentage of soil carbon. At landscape and biome scales, exotic species primarily invaded areas of high species richness in the four Central Grasslands sites and in the five Colorado Rockies vegetation types. For the nine vegetation types in both biomes, exotic species cover was positively correlated with mean foliar cover, mean soil percentage N, and the total number of exotic species. These patterns of invasibility depend on spatial scale, biome and vegetation type, spatial autocorrelation effects, availability of resources, and species-specific responses to grazing and other disturbances. We conclude that: (1) sites high in herbaceous foliar cover and soil fertility, and hot spots of plant diversity (and biodiversity), are invasible in many landscapes; and (2) this pattern may be more closely related to the degree resources are available in native plant communities, independent of species richness. Exotic plant invasions in rare habitats and distinctive plant communities pose a significant challenge to land managers and conservation biologists.",

In this forum paper we discuss how soil scientists can help to reach the recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the most effective manner. Soil science, as a land-related discipline, has important links to several of the SDGs, which are demonstrated through the functions of soils and the ecosystem services that are linked to those functions (see graphical abstract in the Supplement). We explore and discuss how soil scientists can rise to the challenge both internally, in terms of our procedures and practices, and externally, in terms of our relations with colleague scientists in other disciplines, diverse groups of stakeholders and the policy arena. To meet these goals we recommend the following steps to be taken by the soil science community as a whole: (i) embrace the UN SDGs, as they provide a platform that allows soil science to demonstrate its relevance for realizing a sustainable society by 2030; (ii) show the specific value of soil science: research should explicitly show how using modern soil information can improve the results of inter- and transdisciplinary studies on SDGs related to food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats; (iii) take leadership in overarching system analysis of ecosystems, as soils and soil scientists have an integrated nature and this places soil scientists in a unique position; (iii) raise awareness of soil organic matter as a key attribute of soils to illustrate its importance for soil functions and ecosystem services; (iv) improve the transfer of knowledge through knowledge brokers with a soil background; (v) start at the basis: educational programmes are needed at all levels, starting in primary schools, and emphasizing practical, down-to-earth examples; (vi) facilitate communication with the policy arena by framing research in terms that resonate with politicians in terms of the policy cycle or by considering drivers, pressures and responses affecting impacts of land use change; and finally (vii) all this is only possible if researchers, with soil scientists in the front lines, look over the hedge towards other disciplines, to the world at large and to the policy arena, reaching over to listen first, as a basis for genuine collaboration.",

Abstract This paper presents a first comprehensive comparison of environmental impacts of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. Life cycle assessment studies found in the literature have been reviewed for these purposes. In total, 27 studies have been found of which 11 focus on CCS and 16 on CCU. The CCS studies suggest that the global warming potential (GWP) from power plants can be reduced by 63\u201382%, with the greatest reductions achieved by oxy-fuel combustion in pulverised coal and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants and the lowest by post-combustion capture in combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. However, other environmental impacts such as acidification and human toxicity are higher with than without CCS. For CCU, the GWP varies widely depending on the utilisation option. Mineral carbonation can reduce the GWP by 4\u201348% compared to no CCU. Utilising CO2 for production of chemicals, specifically, dimethylcarbonate (DMC) reduces the GWP by 4.3 times and ozone layer depletion by 13 times compared to the conventional DMC process. Enhanced oil recovery has the GWP 2.3 times lower compared to discharging CO2 to the atmosphere but acidification is three times higher. Capturing CO2 by microalgae to produce biodiesel has 2.5 times higher GWP than fossil diesel with other environmental impacts also significantly higher. On average, the GWP of CCS is significantly lower than of the CCU options. However, its other environmental impacts are higher compared to CCU except for DMC production which is the worst CCU option overall.",

In preparation for the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the international community is developing new advanced Earth System Models (ESMs) to assess the combined effects of human activities (e.g. land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. In addition, four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of the future (2005\u20132100) are being provided by four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams to be used as input to the ESMs for future carbon-climate projections (Moss et al. 2010). The diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and ESMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Here, a harmonized set of land-use scenarios are presented that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections, in the format required by ESMs. The land-use harmonization strategy estimates fractional land-use patterns and underlying land-use transitions annually for the time period 1500\u20132100 at 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 resolution.

The computational method integrates these multiple data sources, while minimizing differences at the transition between the historical reconstruction ending conditions and IAM initial conditions, and working to preserve the future changes depicted by the IAMs at the grid cell level. This study for the first time harmonizes land-use history data together with future scenario information from multiple IAMs into a single consistent, spatially gridded, set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system.",

A key issue in the design of an effective retrofitting solution using externally bonded plates is the end anchorage strength. This paper first presents a review of current anchorage strength models for both FRP-to-concrete and steel-to-concrete bonded joints under shear. These models are then assessed with experimental data collected from the literature, revealing the deficiencies of all existing models. Finally, a new simple and rational model is proposed based on an existing fracture mechanics analysis and experimental observations. This new model not only matches experimental observations of bond strength closely, but also correctly predicts the effective bond length. The new model is thus suitable for practical application in the design of FRP-to-concrete as well as steel-to-concrete bonded joints.",

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proposed and actively explored as multipurpose innovative carriers for drug delivery and diagnostic applications. Their versatile physicochemical features enable the covalent and noncovalent introduction of several pharmaceutically relevant entities and allow for rational design of novel candidate nanoscale constructs for drug development. CNTs can be functionalized with different functional groups to carry simultaneously several moieties for targeting, imaging, and therapy. Among the most interesting examples of such multimodal CNT constructs described in this Account is one carrying a fluorescein probe together with the antifungal drug amphotericin B or fluorescein and the antitumor agent methotrexate. The biological action of the drug in these cases is retained or, as in the case of amphotericin B constructs, enhanced, while CNTs are able to reduce the unwanted toxicity of the drug administered alone. Ammonium-functionalized CNTs can also be considered very promising vectors for gene-encoding nucleic acids. Indeed, we have formed stable complexes between cationic CNTs and plasmid DNA and demonstrated the enhancement of the gene therapeutic capacity in comparison to DNA alone. On the other hand, CNTs conjugated with antigenic peptides can be developed as a new and effective system for synthetic vaccine applications. What makes CNTs quite unique is their ability, first shown by our groups in 2004, to passively cross membranes of many different types of cells following a translocation mechanism that has been termed the nanoneedle mechanism. In that way, CNTs open innumerable possibilities for future drug discovery based on intracellular targets that have been hard to reach until today. Moreover, adequately functionalized CNTs as those shown in this Account can be rapidly eliminated from the body following systemic administration offering further encouragment for their development.

Water splitting is the essential chemical reaction to enable the storage of intermittent energies such as solar and wind in the form of hydrogen fuel. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often considered as the bottleneck in water splitting. Though metal oxides had been reported as OER electrocatalysts more than half a century ago, the recent interest in renewable energy storage has spurred a renaissance of the studies of transition metal oxides as Earth-abundant and nonprecious OER catalysts. This Perspective presents major progress in several key areas of the field such as theoretical understanding, activity trend, in situ and operando characterization, active site determination, and novel materials. A personal overview of the past achievements and future challenges is also provided.",

    "text":"Oxy-fuel combustion of solid fuels. Oxy-fuel combustion is suggested as one of the possible, promising technologies for capturing CO2 from power plants. The concept of oxy-fuel combustion is removal of nitrogen from the oxidizer to carry out the combustion process in oxygen and, in most concepts, recycled flue gas to lower the flame temperature. The flue gas produced thus consists primarily of carbon dioxide and water. Much research on the different aspects of an oxy-fuel power plant has been performed during the last decade. Focus has mainly been on retrofits of existing pulverized-coal-fired power plant units. Green-field plants which provide additional options for improvement of process economics are however likewise investigated. Of particular interest is the change of the combustion process induced by the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor for nitrogen as diluent. This paper reviews the published knowledge on the oxy-fuel process and focuses particularly on the combustion fundamentals, i.e. flame temperatures and heat transfer, ignition and burnout, emissions, and fly ash characteristics. Knowledge is currently available regarding both an entire oxy-fuel power plant and the combustion fundamentals. However, several questions remain unanswered and more research and pilot plant testing of heat transfer profiles, emission levels, the optimum oxygen excess and inlet oxygen concentration levels, high and low-temperature fire-side corrosion, ash quality, plant operability, and models to predict NOx and SO3 formation is required.",

ABSTRACT Green roofs (roofs with a vegetated surface and substrate) provide ecosystem services in urban areas, including improved storm-water management, better regulation of building temperatures, reduced urban heat-island effects, and increased urban wildlife habitat. This article reviews the evidence for these benefits and examines the biotic and abiotic components that contribute to overall ecosystem services. We emphasize the potential for improving green-roof function by understanding the interactions between its ecosystem elements, especially the relationships among growing media, soil biota, and vegetation, and the interactions between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Further research into green-roof technology should assess the efficacy of green roofs compared to other technologies with similar ends, and ultimately focus on estimates of aggregate benefits at landscape scales and on more holistic cost-benefit analyses.",

    "text":"The global nitrogen cycle in the twenty-first century. Global nitrogen fixation contributes 413 Tg of reactive nitrogen (N r ) to terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually of which anthropogenic activities are responsible for half, 210 Tg N. The majority of the transformations of anthropogenic N r are on land (240 Tg N yr \u22121 ) within soils and vegetation where reduced N r contributes most of the input through the use of fertilizer nitrogen in agriculture. Leakages from the use of fertilizer N r contribute to nitrate (NO 3 \u2212 ) in drainage waters from agricultural land and emissions of trace N r compounds to the atmosphere. Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH 3 ) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), contribute 100 Tg N yr \u22121 to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ) and ammonium sulfate (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . Leaching and riverine transport of NO 3 contribute 40\u201370 Tg N yr \u22121 to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 Tg N yr \u22121 ) to double the ocean processing of N r . Some of the marine N r is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N 2 or N 2 O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of N r in the atmosphere, with the exception of N 2 O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 10 2 \u201310 3 years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of N r is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N 2 O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of N r from which it is produced.",

The density functional theory method (M05-2X\/6-31G(d)) was used to investigate reaction mechanisms for deoxygenation of graphene oxides (GOs) with hydrazine or heat treatment. Three mechanisms were identified as reducing epoxide groups of GO with hydrazine as a reducing agent. No reaction path was found for the hydrazine-mediated reductions of the hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups of GO. We instead discovered the mechanisms for dehydroxylation, decarbonylation, and decarboxylation using heat treatment. The hydrazine de-epoxidation and thermal dehydroxylation of GO have opposite dependencies on the reaction temperature. In both reduction types, the oxygen functionalities attached to the interior of an aromatic domain in GO are removed more easily, both kinetically and thermodynamically, than those attached at the edges of an aromatic domain.

Bacillus subtilis (natto) is the key microbial participant in the ongoing production of the soya-based traditional natto fermentation, and some Bacillus species are on the Food and Drug Administration's GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list. The capacity of selected Bacillus strains to produce and secrete large quantities (20-25 g\/L) of extracellular enzymes has placed them among the most important industrial enzyme producers. The ability of different species to ferment in the acid, neutral, and alkaline pH ranges, combined with the presence of thermophiles in the genus, has lead to the development of a variety of new commercial enzyme products with the desired temperature, pH activity, and stability properties to address a variety of specific applications. Classical mutation and (or) selection techniques, together with advanced cloning and protein engineering strategies, have been exploited to develop these products. Efforts to produce and secrete high yields of foreign recombinant proteins in Bacillus hosts initially appeared to be hampered by the degradation of the products by the host proteases. Recent studies have revealed that the slow folding of heterologous proteins at the membrane-cell wall interface of Gram-positive bacteria renders them vulnerable to attack by wall-associated proteases. In addition, the presence of thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases in B. subtilis may be beneficial in the secretion of disulphide-bond-containing proteins. Such developments from our understanding of the complex protein translocation machinery of Gram-positive bacteria should allow the resolution of current secretion challenges and make Bacillus species preeminent hosts for heterologous protein production. Bacillus strains have also been developed and engineered as industrial producers of nucleotides, the vitamin riboflavin, the flavor agent ribose, and the supplement poly-gamma-glutamic acid. With the recent characterization of the genome of B. subtilis 168 and of some related strains, Bacillus species are poised to become the preferred hosts for the production of many new and improved products as we move through the genomic and proteomic era.",

Genetics-based evidence provides fundamental insights into the diversity, ecology, and origins of many biological systems, including the mutualisms between metazoan hosts and their micro-algal partners. A well-known example is the dinoflagellate endosymbionts (\u201czooxanthellae\u201d) that power the growth of stony corals and coral reef ecosystems. Once assumed to encompass a single panmictic species, genetic evidence has revealed a divergent and rich diversity within the zooxanthella genus Symbiodinium. Despite decades of reporting on the significance of this diversity, the formal systematics of these eukaryotic microbes have not kept pace, and a major revision is long overdue.

Its adoption will facilitate scientific dialog and future research on the physiology, ecology, and evolution of these important micro-algae. Symbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium have been the subjects of considerable scientific investigation, especially in recent decades. Their mutualisms with many reefal invertebrates, notably stony corals, are fundamental to the existence of tropical and subtropical coral reef ecosystems worldwide. The recent, rapid decline of these marine communities emphasizes how many of Earth\u2019s ecosystems are in danger of collapse from anthropogenic global change. However, it is clear from the fossil record that some reef-building corals, and hence their obligate symbioses, have been resilient to major changes in climate [1Wood R. The ecological evolution of reefs.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1998; 29: 179-206Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Kiessling W. Geologic and biologic controls on the evolution of reefs.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2009; 40: 173-192Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar]. The specific identities of resident Symbiodinium influence their host\u2019s susceptibility to hot and cold ocean temperatures, contributing to broad disparities in thermal tolerance among individual colonies and host species [3Berkelmans R. van Oppen M.J. The role of zooxanthellae in the thermal tolerance of corals: a \u2018nugget of hope\u2019 for coral reefs in an era of climate change.Proc. Biol.

Therefore, recognizing the diversity, physiology, and ecology of these endosymbionts is paramount for understanding how algal-invertebrate partnerships might respond to rapid shifts in Earth\u2019s climate. Some of the earliest investigations of cultured Symbiodinium revealed differences in morphology (cell size, chloroplast and mitochondria volumes), biochemistry (metabolites), physiology (photosynthetic abilities), behavior (motility and host specificity), and genetics (chromosome number and variation in allozyme alleles), which collectively led to the proposition that more than a single panmictic symbiont species existed [6Schoenberg D.A. Trench R.K. Genetic variation in Symbiodinium (= Gymnodinium) microadriaticum Freudenthal, and specificity in its symbiosis with marine invertebrates. III. specificity and infectivity of Symbiodinium microadriaticum.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1980; 207: 445-460Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Blank R.J. Trench R.K. Speciation and symbiotic dinoflagellates.Science. 1985; 229: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar]. Several new species were indeed described [8Trench R.K. Blank R.J.

Phycol. 1987; 23: 469-481Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar], but these early reports had little traction in the research community at the time. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of Symbiodinium ribosomal genes (rDNA) sought to broadly characterize the diversity and evolutionary relationships among these symbionts and their hosts [9Rowan R. Powers D.A. A molecular genetic classification of zooxanthellae and the evolution of animal-algal symbioses.Science. 1991; 251: 1348-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar]. Phylogenetic reconstructions immediately revealed the genus Symbiodinium to be composed of many evolutionarily divergent lineages [9Rowan R. Powers D.A. A molecular genetic classification of zooxanthellae and the evolution of animal-algal symbioses.Science. 1991; 251: 1348-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 10Rowan R. Powers D.A. Ribosomal RNA sequences and the diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 3639-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar]. In recognizing their phylogenetic disparity, these lineages were provisionally designated by arbitrary letters (e.g., A, B, C) that became referred to as \u201cclades\u201d [11Rowan R. Knowlton N. Intraspecific diversity and ecological zonation in coral-algal symbiosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar]. Historically, these clade designations often appeared in the literature as species-level equivalents. With the emergence of molecular techniques in recent decades, there has been widespread recognition that most Symbiodinium clades contain numerous \u201csub-clades,\u201d \u201ctypes,\u201d or \u201cstrains.\u201d Notably, most of these within-clade entities exhibit distinct and sometimes substantial differences in their genetics, physiology, and\/or ecology\u2014attributes that fulfill the prerequisites of multiple species concepts [12LaJeunesse T.C.

USA. 2015; 112: 7513-7518Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar]. Confusion is likely to persist if only a single genus continues to encompass hundreds of both closely and distantly related species. It is therefore necessary to update Symbiodinium systematics to incorporate our modern understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the group. There are abundant reasons, beyond alleviating confusion, to justify replacing historical Symbiodinium clades with formal genus names. As Rowan and Powers [10Rowan R. Powers D.A. Ribosomal RNA sequences and the diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 3639-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar] first recognized, the genetic divergences among clades is similar to, and often much greater than, genetic distances separating other dinoflagellate genera, families, and sometimes orders [24Stern R.F.

This is unsurprising given that provisional molecular clock estimates conservatively place the divergence among clades beginning in the early Cenozoic Era [26Tchernov D. Gorbunov M.Y. de Vargas C.

Molecular dating using calibrations times (Figure S1) based on the separation of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins in the Pliocene (5.2\u20133.1 mya) as well as the adaptive radiation of soritid foraminifera in the Eocene (55\u201342 mya; Figures S2A and S2B) in BEAST 2 [34Bouckaert R. Heled J. Kuhnert D. Vaughan T. Wu C.H. Xie D. Suchard M.A. Rambaut A. Drummond A.J. BEAST 2: a software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003537Crossref PubMed Scopus (4096) Google Scholar] placed the age of the Symbiodiniaceae back to the middle Mesozoic at approximately 160 mya (posterior estimates; Figures 1A and 1B ). The particular geological chronology shown in Figure 1A was generated from estimates based on \u201cold\u201d (or \u201cearly\u201d) calibration time \u201c2\u201d involving the divergence point of two distantly related Clade D lineages sharing a most recent common ancestor, but with different host specificities: one associated with foraminifera and the other with cnidarians (Figure S3). The \u201cyoung\u201d (or \u201clate\u201d) calibration time \u201c4\u201d that was used involved sibling Clade C lineages associated with sibling Porites corals from the Greater Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, respectively (justifications for all calibration times are detailed in the STAR Methods section Quantification and Statistical Analysis). With these calibrations, a mean clock rate for LSU rDNA evolution was estimated at 2.08 \u00d7 10\u22123 (\u00b12.84 \u00d7 10\u22124 Stdev) substitutions per site per million years (based on a strict clock model). Other combinations of old (early) and young (late) calibration times returned similar, and sometimes older, estimates of divergence among Symbiodiniaceae clades (data not shown). Mean cell sizes among Symbiodiniaceae species are small relative to other Suessiales (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S1) and range from \u223c6 \u03bcm among species in Clade B to \u223c12 \u03bcm in non-symbiotic S. voratum in Clade E. The number, shape, and arrangement of amphiesmal plates are similar across most clade representatives (Figure 2C). Differences in plate number and shape can be as great between species within a clade as they are among clades (Figure 2C). The only verified morphological autapomorphy diagnostic of any clade is the lack of a pronounced elongate apical vesicle (EAV), also called the \u201cacrobase\u201d or apical furrow apparatus, among members of Clade C (Figure 2C). We compared model-corrected inter- and intra-clade (or in some cases, sub-clade) LSU rDNA genetic divergence estimates for Symbiodiniaceae with inter- and intra-genus divergence estimates for other members of the class Dinophyceae (Figure 3A). The mean inter-distance values were similar among groups (25.1% \u00b1 7.40% between Symbiodiniaceae clades; 39.4% \u00b1 17.5% between Dinophyceae genera), as were the mean intra-clade values (1.41% \u00b1 1.06% within Symbiodiniaceae clades; 9.12% \u00b1 11.9% within Dinophyceae genera). Notably, all \u201cbetween\u201d values were >5% (with the exception of the Dinophyceae contrast between Ansanella\u2014Protodinium at 4.93%). Meanwhile, all \u201cwithin\u201d values were < 5% (for all Symbiodiniaceae clades; several Dinophyceae genera had higher values). Mitochondrial cytochrome b (mt cob) analyses produced analogous results, albeit with smaller distance values. Mean inter-clade or -genus mt cob estimates for Symbiodiniaceae and Dinophyceae were 7.48% \u00b1 2.95% and 10.5% \u00b1 5.10%, respectively, and intra-clade or -genus estimates for Symbiodiniaceae and Dinophyceae were 0.241% \u00b1 0.158% and 1.38% \u00b1 2.32%, respectively (Figure 3B). To substantiate the sequence divergence observed from LSU rDNA and mt cob data (Figures 3A and 3B, Tables S2 and S3), transcriptomic comparisons were conducted between representative species from Clades A, B, and F (\u201csub-clade\u201d Fr5) to identify levels of shared orthologous genes derived from a common ancestor (Figure 3C). We found a much higher proportion of orthologs within a clade (71% for Clade B Symbiodinium minutum versus Clade B S. psygmophilum) than between clades (10%\u201322% for pairwise contrasts of Clade A S. microadriaticum, Clade B S. minutum, and Clade F S. kawagutii; Figure 3C). When these values were plotted against divergence times estimated from the LSU rDNA data (above), there was a clear pattern of rapidly decreasing orthology with increasing time since divergence (Figure 3C). The earliest comparison of rDNA sequences obtained from the algal symbionts of reef corals and other invertebrates indicated that they were the product of a long evolutionary history [10Rowan R. Powers D.A. Ribosomal RNA sequences and the diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 3639-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar]. Our revised age for the Symbiodiniaceae coincides with the adaptive radiation of calcifying corals and reef growth during the middle Jurassic Period (Figure 1B) [35Simpson C. Kiessling W. Mewis H. Baron-Szabo R.C. M\u00fcller J. Evolutionary diversification of reef corals: a comparison of the molecular and fossil records.Evolution. 2011; 65: 3274-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar]. Therefore, these findings bring into alignment the ancient origin and success of reef-building corals with the evolution of the Symbiodiniaceae. They further imply that Symbiodiniaceae have persisted through tens of millions of years of Earth\u2019s history while enduring large and numerous environmental changes. Independent geochemical and morphological data indicate the emergence of photosymbioses early in scleractinian evolution [37Stanley G.D. The evolution of modern corals and their early history.Earth Sci. Rev. 2003; 60: 195-225Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar]. Changes in isotopic abundances in \u03b4 18O and \u03b4 13C [38Stanley G.D. Swart P.K. Evolution of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis during the Triassic: a geochemical approach.Paleobiology. 1995; 21: 179-199Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar] and characteristics of skeletal banding patterns [39Stanley G.D. Helmle K.P. Middle Triassic coral growth bands and their implication for photosymbiosis.Palaios. 2010; 25: 754-763Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar] during the Late Triassic are proxies for the presence of photosynthetic biochemistry. However, early symbiotic coral species became extinct during the End-Triassic mass extinction event (Figure 1B). If our estimates placing the origination and diversification of Symbiodiniaceae in the middle to late Jurassic are accurate, modern-day coral-algal symbioses first emerged during the second, and much larger, scleractinian radiation, when communities of these animals began to build reef structures and gave rise to lineages of modern reef corals [35Simpson C. Kiessling W. Mewis H. Baron-Szabo R.C. M\u00fcller J. Evolutionary diversification of reef corals: a comparison of the molecular and fossil records.Evolution. 2011; 65: 3274-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Stanley Jr., G.D. Ecology. Photosymbiosis and the evolution of modern coral reefs.Science. 2006; 312: 857-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]. These Jurassic corals evolved and rapidly diversified after a long geological dormancy\u2014which lasted tens of millions of years, a consequence of the End-Triassic mass extinction (Figure 1B)\u2014and were distinct from their Triassic cousins [35Simpson C. Kiessling W. Mewis H. Baron-Szabo R.C. M\u00fcller J. Evolutionary diversification of reef corals: a comparison of the molecular and fossil records.Evolution. 2011; 65: 3274-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar]. A Mesozoic origin of the Symbiodiniaceae is considerably older than previous approximations, which proposed relatively recent origins of the family in the Paleocene or Eocene epochs, 50\u201365 mya [26Tchernov D. Gorbunov M.Y. de Vargas C. Narayan Yadav S. Milligan A.J. H\u00e4ggblom M. Falkowski P.G. Membrane lipids of symbiotic algae are diagnostic of sensitivity to thermal bleaching in corals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 13531-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 27Pochon X. Montoya-Burgos J.I. Stadelmann B. Pawlowski J. Molecular phylogeny, evolutionary rates, and divergence timing of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium.Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2006; 38: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar]. However, our assessment of contemporary phylogenetic, geographic, and paleontological evidence identified calibration problems with these earlier molecular clocks, making the likelihood of a Cenozoic Era origination doubtful (see the STAR Methods section Quantification and Statistical Analysis). These issues included the following: (1) using sequences from geographically inappropriate origins to calibrate the separation between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Figure S4); (2) relying on fossil dates from only extant host lineages that are part of a much older group (Figures S2A and S2B); and (3) using a molecular clock calibrated from fossils of a dinoflagellate order whose lineages show accelerated rates of rDNA evolution relative to other genes (Figure 4G). Ultimately, the estimates of evolutionary times presented in Figure 1A reflect a more parsimonious correspondence with the history of modern zooxanthellate shallow-water corals [41Coates A.G. Jackson J.B. Clonal growth, algal symbiosis, and reef formation by corals.Paleobiology. 1987; 13: 363-378Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Stanley G.D. van de Schootbrugge B. The evolution of the coral-algal symbiosis.in: van Oppen M.J. Lough J.M. Coral Bleaching. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg2009: 7-19Crossref Google Scholar]. Additionally, the dates estimated for many internal and recent branch nodes appear consistent with timings of plate tectonic changes that affected biogeographic patterns and drove shifts in paleo-climates [e.g., 43O\u2019Dea A. Lessios H.A. Coates A.G. Eytan R.I. Restrepo-Moreno S.A. Cione A.L. Collins L.S. de Queiroz A. Farris D.W. Norris R.D. et al.Formation of the Isthmus of Panama.Sci. Adv. 2016; 2: e1600883Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar], likely influencing the emergence and success of new lineages. The reliability of molecular dating is not only dependent on accurate calibration points but also on a relatively robust phylogeny [44Smith A.B. Peterson K.J. Dating the time of origin of major clades: molecular clocks and the fossil record.Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 2002; 30: 65-88Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar]. The future use of additional genes for molecular dating will be important to test their congruence with dates based on LSU rDNA, as well as to evaluate the evolutionary hypotheses raised by these newest estimates [e.g., 21Thornhill D.J. Lewis A.M. Wham D.C. LaJeunesse T.C. Host-specialist lineages dominate the adaptive radiation of reef coral endosymbionts.Evolution. 2014; 68: 352-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar]. However, LSU rDNA is currently the most versatile gene for analyses of evolutionary history between clades of Symbiodiniaceae. It is the only gene known to provide sufficient resolution to delimit most putative species while being conserved enough to conduct a phylogenetic analysis among distantly related Dinophyceae [45Moestrup O. Daugbjerg N. On dinoflagellate phylogeny and classification.in: Brodie J. Lewis J. Unravelling the algae: the past, present, and future of algal systematics.

Besides the classical route to produce activated carbons from agricultural side products, the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process shows clear advantages in that it can generate a variety of cheap and sustainable carbonaceous materials with attractive nanostructure and functionalization patterns for a wide range of applications. In this tutorial review we present the latest developments in this traditional but recently invigorated technique. It will be shown that HTC does not only access carbonaceous materials under comparatively mild hydrothermal conditions, but also replaces the more technical and structurally well-defined charring by a controlled chemical process. It will be shown that this makes it possible to tailor the final structure with the tools of colloid and polymer science, leading to very different morphologies with miscellaneous applications, including modern carbon nanocomposites and hybrids.",

It has been revealed that three independent response pathways separately regulate induction of the expression of chaperones, ERAD components, and translational attenuation.

Radiation damping due to the emission of $\\ensuremath{\\gamma}$-rays broadens the resonance and reduces scattering in comparison with absorption by a large factor.

Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m\/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens.

Competition belowground can be stronger and involve many more neighbors than aboveground competition. Physiological ecologists and population or community ecologists have traditionally studied belowground competition from different perspectives. Physiologically based studies often measure resource uptake without determining the integrated consequences for plant performance, while population or community level studies examine plant performance but fail to identify the resource intermediary or mechanism. Belowground competitive ability is correlated with such attributes as root density, surface area, and plasticity either in root growth or in the properties of enzymes involved in nutrient uptake. Unlike competition for light, in which larger plants have a disproportionate advantage by shading smaller ones, competition for soil resources is apparently more symmetric. Belowground competition often decreases with increases in nutrient levels, but it is premature to generalize about the relative importance of above- and belowground competition across resource gradients. Although shoot and root competition are often assumed to have additive effects on plant growth, some studies provide evidence to the contrary, and potential interactions between the two forms of competition should be considered in future investigations. Other research recommendations include the simultaneous study of root and shoot gaps, since their closures may not occur simultaneously, and improved estimates of the belowground neighborhood.

Embedded in nanocrystals, they can serve, for example, as robust single-photon sources or as fluorescent biomarkers of unlimited photostability and low cytotoxicity. The most fascinating aspect, however, is the ability of some crystal defects, most prominently the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, to locally detect and measure a number of physical quantities, such as magnetic and electric fields. This metrology capacity is based on the quantum mechanical interactions of the defect's spin state. In this review, we introduce the new and rapidly evolving field of nanoscale sensing based on single NV centers in diamond. We give a concise overview of the basic properties of diamond, from synthesis to electronic and magnetic properties of embedded NV centers. We describe in detail how single NV centers can be harnessed for nanoscale sensing, including the physical quantities that may be detected, expected sensitivities, and the most common measurement protocols. We conclude by highlighting a number of the diverse and exciting applications that may be enabled by these novel sensors, ranging from measurements of ion concentrations and membrane potentials to nanoscale thermometry and single-spin nuclear magnetic resonance.",

The protocol runs into some trouble, however, if one or both starting carbon centers are saturated (purely single-bonded). Tellis et al. and Zuo et al. independently found that combining a second, light-activated catalyst with a nickel cross-coupling catalyst could achieve selective coupling of saturated and unsaturated reagents (see the Perspective by Lloyd-Jones and Ball).

Recent studies have defined a key function for the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor E3 ubiquitin ligase (VHLE3) in this process, and have defined an interaction with HIF-1 alpha that is regulated by prolyl hydroxylation. Here we show that two independent regions within the HIF-alpha oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) are targeted for ubiquitylation by VHLE3 in a manner dependent upon prolyl hydroxylation. In a series of in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrate the independent and non-redundant operation of each site in regulation of the HIF system. Both sites contain a common core motif, but differ both in overall sequence and in the conditions under which they bind to the VHLE3 ligase complex. The definition of two independent destruction domains implicates a more complex system of pVHL-HIF-alpha interactions, but reinforces the role of prolyl hydroxylation as an oxygen-dependent destruction signal.",

Quantifying these differences for more than a few species, however, has proven difficult. Therefore, to understand better how species differ in their capacity for CO2 assimilation, a widely used model, capable of partitioning limitations to the activity of ribulose-l,5-W.sphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, to the rate of ribulose 1,5-tophosphate regeneration via electron transport, and to the rate of triose phosphate utilization was used to analyse 164 previously published A\/C, curves for 109 C3 plant species. Based on this analysis, the maximum rate of carboxylation, Vcmax, ranged from 6\/umol m~2 s1 for the coniferous species Picea abies to 194jj,mol m 2 s1 for the agricultural species Beta vulgaris, and averaged 64^mol m 2 s1 across all species. The maximum rate of electron transport, Jmx, ranged from 17\/^mol m~2 s1 again for Picea abies to 372\/j.mol m~2 s1 for the desert annual Mahastrum rotundifolium, and averaged 134fxmol m~2 s1 across all species. A strong positive correlation between Vc^x and Jmax indicated that the assimilation of CO2 was regulated in a co-ordinated manner by these two component processes. Of the AjC{ curves analysed, 23 showed either an insensitivity or reversed-sensitivity to increasing CO2 concentration, indicating that CO2 assimilation was limited by the utilization of triose phosphates. The rate of triose phosphate utilization ranged from 4-9\/xtnol m 2 s1 for the tropical perennial Tabebuia rosea to 20-1 \/xmol m~2 s1 for the weedy annual Xanthium strumarium, and averaged 101 ftmol m 2 s1 across all species. Despite what at first glance would appear to be a wide range of estimates for the biochemical capacities that regulate CO2 assimilation, separating these species-specific results into those of broad plant categories revealed that Vcmax and Jmax were in general higher for herbaceous annuals than they were for woody perennials. For annuals, Vc^^ and Jmax averaged 75 and 154ftmol m~2 s1, while for perennials these same two parameters averaged only 44 and 97\/xmol m~2 s1, respectively. Although these differences between groups may be coincidental, such an observation points to differences between annuals and perennials in either the availability or allocation of resources to the gas-exchange process.",

The long-term net flux of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere has been dominated by two factors: changes in the area of forests and per hectare changes in forest biomass resulting from management and regrowth. While these factors are reasonably well documented in countries of the northern mid-latitudes as a result of systematic forest inventories, they are uncertain in the tropics. Recent estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation have focused on the uncertainty in rates of deforestation. By using the same data for biomass, however, these studies have underestimated the total uncertainty of tropical emissions and may have biased the estimates. In particular, regional and country-specific estimates of forest biomass reported by three successive assessments of tropical forest resources by the FAO indicate systematic changes in biomass that have not been taken into account in recent estimates of tropical carbon emissions. The \u2018changes\u2019 more likely represent improved information than real on-the-ground changes in carbon storage.

Streams and their adjacent riparian zones are closely linked by reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey. We review characteristics of these prey subsidies and their strong direct and indirect effects on consumers and recipient food webs. 2. Fluxes of terrestrial invertebrates to streams can provide up to half the annual energy budget for drift-feeding fishes such as salmonids, despite the fact that input occurs principally in summer. Inputs appear highest from closed-canopy riparian zones with deciduous vegetation and vary markedly with invertebrate phenology and weather. Two field experiments that manipulated this prey subsidy showed that it affected both foraging and local abundance of stream fishes. 3. Emergence of adult insects from streams can constitute a substantial export of benthic production to riparian consumers such as birds, bats, lizards, and spiders, and contributes 25\u2013100% of the energy or carbon to such species. Emergence typically peaks in early summer in the temperate zone, but also provides a low-level flux from autumn to spring in ice-free streams. This flux varies with in-stream productivity, and declines exponentially with distance from the stream edge. Some predators aggregate near streams and forage on these prey during periods of peak emergence, whereas others rely on the lower subsidy from autumn through spring when terrestrial prey are scarce. Several field experiments that manipulated this subsidy showed that it affected the short-term behaviour, growth, and abundance of terrestrial consumers. 4. Reciprocal prey subsidies also have important indirect effects on both stream and riparian food webs. Theory predicts that allochthonous prey should increase density of subsidised predators, thereby increasing predation on in situ prey and causing a negative indirect effect via apparent competition. However, short-term experiments have produced either positive or negative indirect effects. These contrasting results may be due to characteristics of the subsidies and individual consumers, but could also result from differences in experimental designs. 5. New study approaches are needed to better determine the direct and indirect effects of reciprocal prey subsidies. Experiments coupled with comparative research will be required to measure their effects on individual consumer fitness and population demographics. Future work should investigate whether reciprocal prey fluxes stabilise linked stream\u2013riparian ecosystems, explore how landscape context affects the magnitude and importance of subsidies, and determine how impacts of human disturbance can propagate between streams and riparian zones via these trophic linkages. Study of these reciprocal connections is helping to define a more holistic perspective of catchments, and has the potential to shape new directions for ecology in general.",

Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a new sample preparation technique using a fused-silica fiber that is coated on the outside with an appropriate stationary phase. Analyte in the sample is directly extracted to the fiber coating. The SPME technique can be used routinely in combination with gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or LC-MS. Furthermore, another SPME technique known as in-tube SPME has also been developed for combination with LC or LC-MS using an open tubular fused-silica capillary column as an SPME device instead of SPME fiber. These methods using SPME techniques save preparation time, solvent purchase and disposal costs, and can improve the detection limits.

Mangrove species are uniquely adapted to tropical and subtropical coasts, and although relatively low in number of species, mangrove forests provide at least US $1.6 billion each year in ecosystem services and support coastal livelihoods worldwide. Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16%) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40% of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced.",

Study design: Thirty neonatal intensive care units in Canada, California, and New England collected data on all admissions during the mid 1990s; patients moribund at birth or discharged to normal newborn care in <24 hours were excluded. Starting with the 34 data elements of the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP), we derived the most parsimonious logistic model for in-hospital mortality using 10,819 randomly selected Canadian cases.

Methods We present a new global distribution map of tropical dry forest derived from the recently developed MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product, which depicts percentage tree cover at a resolution of 500 m, combined with previously defined maps of biomes. This distribution map was overlaid with spatial data to estimate the exposure of tropical dry forests to a number of different threats: climate change, habitat fragmentation, fire, human population density and conversion to cropland. The extent of tropical dry forest currently protected was estimated by overlaying the forest map with a global data set of the distribution of protected areas. Results It is estimated that 1,048,700 km2 of tropical dry forest remains, distributed throughout the three tropical regions. More than half of the forest area (54.2%) is located within South America, the remaining area being almost equally divided between North and Central America, Africa and Eurasia, with a relatively small proportion (3.8%) occurring within Australasia and Southeast Asia. Overall, c. 97% of the remaining area of tropical dry forest is at risk from one or more of the threats considered, with highest percentages recorded for Eurasia. The relative exposure to different threats differed between regions: while climate change is relatively significant in the Americas, habitat fragmentation and fire affect a higher proportion of African forests, whereas agricultural conversion and human population density are most influential in Eurasia. Evidence suggests that c. 300,000 km2 of tropical dry forest now coincide with some form of protected area, with 71.8% of this total being located within South America. Main conclusions Virtually all of the tropical dry forests that remain are currently exposed to a variety of different threats, largely resulting from human activity. Taking their high biodiversity value into consideration, this indicates that tropical dry forests should be accorded high conservation priority. The results presented here could be used to identify which forest areas should be accorded highest priority for conservation action. In particular, the expansion of the global protected area network, particularly in Mesoamerica, should be given urgent consideration.",

    "text":"Phenol oxidase, peroxidase and organic matter dynamics of soil. Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems ( n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32% of SOM variance ( n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage.",

    "text":"Sink regulation of photosynthesis. The concept that photosynthetic flux is influenced by the accumulation of photo\u2010assimilate persisted for 100 years before receiving any strong experimental support. Precise analysis of the mechanisms of photosynthetic responses to sink activity required the development of a battery of appropriate molecular techniques and has benefited from contemporary interest in the effects of elevated CO2 on photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is one of the most highly integrated and regulated metabolic processes to maximize the use of available light, to minimize the damaging effects of excess light and to optimize the use of limiting carbon and nitrogen resources. Hypotheses of feedback regulation must take account of this integration. In the short term, departure from homeostasis can lead to redox signals, which cause rapid changes in the transcription of genes encoding photosystems I and II. End\u2010product synthesis can exert short\u2010term metabolic feedback control through Pi recycling. Beyond this, carbohydrate accumulation in leaves when there is an imbalance between source and sink at the whole plant level can lead to decreased expression of photosynthetic genes and accelerated leaf senescence. In a high CO2 world this may become a more prevalent feature of photosynthetic regulation. However, sink regulation of photosynthesis is highly dependent on the physiology of the rest of the plant. This physiological state regulates photosynthesis through signal transduction pathways that co\u2010ordinate the plant carbon : nitrogen balance, which match photosynthetic capacity to growth and storage capacity and underpin and can override the direct short\u2010term controls of photosynthesis by light and CO2. Photosynthate supply and phytohormones, particularly cytokinins, interact with nitrogen supply to control the expression of photosynthesis genes, the development of leaves and the whole plant nitrogen distribution, which provides the dominant basis for sink regulation of photosynthesis.",

    "text":"Developmental regulation of intestinal angiogenesis by indigenous microbes via Paneth cells. The adult mouse intestine contains an intricate vascular network. The factors that control development of this network are poorly understood. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging studies revealed that a plexus of branched interconnected vessels developed in small intestinal villi during the period of postnatal development that coincides with assembly of a complex society of indigenous gut microorganisms (microbiota). To investigate the impact of this environmental transition on vascular development, we compared the capillary networks of germ-free mice with those of ex-germ-free animals colonized during or after completion of postnatal gut development. Adult germ-free mice had arrested capillary network formation. The developmental program can be restarted and completed within 10 days after colonization with a complete microbiota harvested from conventionally raised mice, or with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , a prominent inhabitant of the normal mouse\/human gut. Paneth cells in the intestinal epithelium secrete antibacterial peptides that affect luminal microbial ecology. Comparisons of germ-free and B. thetaiotaomicron -colonized transgenic mice lacking Paneth cells established that microbial regulation of angiogenesis depends on this lineage. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of postnatal animal development, where microbes colonizing a mucosal surface are assigned responsibility for regulating elaboration of the underlying microvasculature by signaling through a bacteria-sensing epithelial cell.",

    "text":"Impact of tropical land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks - a meta-analysis. Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (\u221225%) and perennial crops (\u221230%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (\u22129%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29%) or under cropland fallow (+32%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.",

Emitted to the atmosphere in its elemental form, mercury travels worldwide before oxidizing to a form that deposits to ecosystems. In aquatic systems, mercury can convert into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. People and wildlife are exposed to methylmercury as it bioaccumulates up the food chain.

It has been hypothesized that acid pH promotes local invasive growth and metastasis. The hypothesis that acid mediates invasion proposes that H+ diffuses from the proximal tumor microenvironment into adjacent normal tissues where it causes tissue remodeling that permits local invasion. In the current work, tumor invasion and peritumoral pH were monitored over time using intravital microscopy. In every case, the peritumoral pH was acidic and heterogeneous and the regions of highest tumor invasion corresponded to areas of lowest pH. Tumor invasion did not occur into regions with normal or near-normal extracellular pH. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that cells in the invasive edges expressed the glucose transporter-1 and the sodium\u2013hydrogen exchanger-1, both of which were associated with peritumoral acidosis. In support of the functional importance of our findings, oral administration of sodium bicarbonate was sufficient to increase peritumoral pH and inhibit tumor growth and local invasion in a preclinical model, supporting the acid-mediated invasion hypothesis.

We incubated BC and BC\u2013soil mixtures at two temperatures (30 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C), with and without microbial inoculation, nutrient addition, or manure amendment for four months. Abiotic processes were more important for oxidation of BC than biotic processes during this short-term incubation, as inoculation with microorganisms at 30 \u00b0C did not change any of the measured indicators of surface oxidation. Black C incubated at both 30 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C without microbial activity showed a decrease in pH (in water) from 5.4 to 5.2 and 3.4, as well as an increase in cation exchange capacity (CEC at pH 7) by 53% and 538% and in oxygen (O) content by 4% and 38%, respectively. Boehm titration and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy suggested that formation of carboxylic functional groups was the reason for the enhanced CEC during oxidation. Analysis of surface properties of BC using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the oxidation of BC particles was initiated on the surface. Incubation at 30 \u00b0C only enhanced oxidation on particle surfaces, while oxidation during incubation at 70 \u00b0C penetrated into the interior of particles.

Changes in specific leaf area (SLA, projected leaf area per unit leaf dry mass) and nitrogen partitioning between proteins within leaves occur during the acclimation of plants to their growth irradiance. In this paper, the relative importance of both of these changes in maximizing carbon gain is quantified. Photosynthesis, SLA and nitrogen partitioning within leaves was determined from 10 dicotyledonous C3 species grown in photon irradiances of 200 and 1000 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121. Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area measured under the growth irradiance was, on average, three times higher for high-light-grown plants than for those grown under low light, and two times higher when measured near light saturation. However, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf dry mass was unaltered by growth irradiance because low-light plants had double the SLA. Nitrogen concentrations per unit leaf mass were constant between the two light treatments, but plants grown in low light partitioned a larger fraction of leaf nitrogen into light harvesting. Leaf absorptance was curvilinearly related to chlorophyll content and independent of SLA. Daily photosynthesis per unit leaf dry mass under low-light conditions was much more responsive to changes in SLA than to nitrogen partitioning. Under high light, sensitivity to nitrogen partitioning increased, but changes in SLA were still more important.",

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted upon fusion of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. The mechanisms involved in their biogenesis remain so far unclear although they constitute targets to modulate exosome formation and therefore are a promising tool to understand their functions. We have performed an RNA interference screen targeting twenty-three components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and associated proteins in MHC class II (MHC II)-expressing HeLa-CIITA cells. Silencing of HRS, STAM1, or TSG101 reduced the secretion of EV-associated CD63 and MHC II but each gene altered differently the size and\/or protein composition of secreted EV, as quantified by immuno-electron microscopy. By contrast, depletion of VPS4B augmented this secretion while not altering the features of EVs. For several other ESCRT subunits, the screen did not allow to conclude on their involvement in exosome biogenesis. Interestingly, silencing of ALIX increased MHC II exosomal secretion, due to an overall increase in intracellular MHC II protein and mRNA levels. In human dendritic cells (DCs), ALIX depletion also increased MHC II in the cells, but not in the released CD63-positive EVs. Such differences could be attributed to a higher heterogeneity in size, and higher MHC II and lower CD63 contents in vesicles recovered from DCs as compared to HeLa-CIITA. The results reveal a role for selected ESCRT components and accessory proteins in exosome secretion and composition by HeLa-CIITA. They also highlight biogenetic differences in vesicles secreted by a tumour cell line and primary DCs.",

    "text":"Remote sensing imagery in vegetation mapping: a review. Mapping vegetation through remotely sensed images involves various considerations, processes and techniques. Increasing availability of remotely sensed images due to the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology expands the horizon of our choices of imagery sources. Various sources of imagery are known for their differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive and temporal characteristics and thus are suitable for different purposes of vegetation mapping. Generally, it needs to develop a vegetation classification at first for classifying and mapping vegetation cover from remote sensed images either at a community level or species level. Then, correlations of the vegetation types (communities or species) within this classification system with discernible spectral characteristics of remote sensed imagery have to be identified. These spectral classes of the imagery are finally translated into the vegetation types in the image interpretation process, which is also called image processing. This paper presents an overview of how to use remote sensing imagery to classify and map vegetation cover. Specifically, this paper focuses on the comparisons of popular remote sensing sensors, commonly adopted image processing methods and prevailing classification accuracy assessments. The basic concepts, available imagery sources and classification techniques of remote sensing imagery related to vegetation mapping were introduced, analyzed and compared. The advantages and limitations of using remote sensing imagery for vegetation cover mapping were provided to iterate the importance of thorough understanding of the related concepts and careful design of the technical procedures, which can be utilized to study vegetation cover from remote sensed images.",

Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is an easily available, renewable carbon resource, which has the advantages of being non-toxic, abundant and economical. CO(2) is also attractive as an environmentally friendly chemical reagent, and is especially useful as a phosgene substitute. CO(2) is an \"anhydrous carbonic acid\" that rapidly reacts with basic compounds. Nucleophilic attack at CO(2) conveniently produces carboxyl and carbamoyl groups. Further reactions of these species with electrophiles lead to the formation of organic carbonates and carbamates.

In this Review, we present the perovskite oxide family as a basis for developing such catalysts for (electro)chemical conversions spanning carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen chemistries. A framework for rationalizing activity trends and guiding perovskite oxide catalyst design is described, followed by illustrations of how a robust understanding of perovskite electronic structure provides fundamental insights into activity, stability, and mechanism in oxygen electrocatalysis.

    "text":"Autophagy Induction and Autophagosome Clearance in Neurons: Relationship to Autophagic Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease. Macroautophagy, a major pathway for organelle and protein turnover, has been implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer9s disease (AD). The basis for the profuse accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in affected neurons of the AD brain, however, is unknown. In this study, we show that constitutive macroautophagy in primary cortical neurons is highly efficient, because newly formed autophagosomes are rapidly cleared by fusion with lysosomes, accounting for their scarcity in the healthy brain. Even after macroautophagy is strongly induced by suppressing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase activity with rapamycin or nutrient deprivation, active cathepsin-positive autolysosomes rather than LC3-II-positive autophagosomes predominate, implying efficient autophagosome clearance in healthy neurons. In contrast, selectively impeding late steps in macroautophagy by inhibiting cathepsin-mediated proteolysis within autolysosomes with cysteine- and aspartyl-protease inhibitors caused a marked accumulation of electron-dense double-membrane-limited AVs, containing cathepsin D and incompletely degraded LC3-II in perikarya and neurites. Similar structures accumulated in large numbers when fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes was slowed by disrupting their transport on microtubules with vinblastine. Finally, we find that the autophagic vacuoles accumulating after protease inhibition or prolonged vinblastine treatment strongly resembled AVs that collect in dystrophic neurites in the AD brain and in an AD mouse model. We conclude that macroautophagy is constitutively active and highly efficient in healthy neurons and that the autophagic pathology observed in AD most likely arises from impaired clearance of AVs rather than strong autophagy induction alone. Therapeutic modulation of autophagy in AD may, therefore, require targeting late steps in the autophagic pathway.",

This article interrogates the relationship between two apparently disjointed themes: the consensual presentation and mainstreaming of the global problem of climate change on the one hand and the debate in political theory\/philosophy that centers around the emergence and consolidation of a post-political and post-democratic condition on the other. The argument advanced in this article attempts to tease out this apparently paradoxical condition. On the one hand, the climate is seemingly politicized as never before and has been propelled high on the policy agenda. On the other hand, a number of increasingly influential political philosophers insist on how the post-politicization (or de-politicization) of the public sphere (in parallel and intertwined with processes of neoliberalization) have been key markers of the political process over the past few decades. We proceed in four steps. First, we briefly outline the basic contours of the argument and its premises. Second, we explore the ways in which the present climate conundrum is predominantly staged through the mobilization of particular apocalyptic imaginaries. Third, we argue that this specific (re-)presentation of climate change and its associated policies is sustained by decidedly populist gestures. Finally, we discuss how this particular choreographing of climate change is one of the arenas through which a post-political frame and post-democratic political configuration have been mediated.",

Pertuzumab binds to ErbB2 near the center of domain II, sterically blocking a binding pocket necessary for receptor dimerization and signaling. The ErbB2-pertuzumab structure, combined with earlier mutagenesis data, defines the pertuzumab residues essential for ErbB2 interaction. To analyze the ErbB2 side of the interface, we have mutated a number of residues contacting pertuzumab and examined the effects of these mutations on pertuzumab binding and ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization.

Abstract An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) machine is similar to a conventional steam cycle energy conversion system, but uses an organic fluid such as refrigerants and hydrocarbons instead of water. In recent years, research was intensified on this device as it is being progressively adopted as premier technology to convert low-temperature heat resources into power. Available heat resources are: solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass products, surface seawater, and waste heat from various thermal processes. This paper presents existing applications and analyzes their maturity. Binary geothermal and binary biomass CHP are already mature. Provided the interest to recover waste heat rejected by thermal devices and industrial processes continue to grow, and favorable legislative conditions are adopted, waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle systems in the near future will experience a rapid growth. Solar modular power plants are being intensely investigated at smaller scale for cogeneration applications in buildings but larger plants are also expected in tropical or Sahel regions with constant and low solar radiation intensity. OTEC power plants operating mainly on offshore installations at very low temperature have been advertised as total resource systems and interest on this technology is growing in large isolated islands.",

Amorphous and nanocrystalline carbon films possess special chemical and physical properties such as high chemical inertness, diamond-like properties, and favorable tribological proprieties.

Amorphous and nanocrystalline carbon films can exist in different kinds of matrices and are usually doped with a large amount of hydrogen. Thus, carbon films can be classified as polymer-like, diamond-like, or graphite-like based on the main binding framework. In order to characterize the structure, either direct bonding characterization methods or the indirect bonding characterization methods are employed.

A new approach to chemistry modelling for large-eddy simulation of turbulent reacting flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modelling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Here, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent of reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which describe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast-chemistry and steady-flamelet models for predicting velocity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fuelled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data, while the fast-chemistry and steady-flamelet models both predict an attached flame.",

Additionally, 2 archival female mice of the same strain who had previously been recipients of 200 male fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-sorted CD34(+)lin(-) cells were sacrificed 8 months posttransplantation under the same protocol. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the Y-chromosome was performed on liver tissue. Y-positive hepatocytes, up to 2.2% of total hepatocytes, were identified in 1 animal at 7 days posttransplantation and in all animals sacrificed 2 months or longer posttransplantation. Simultaneous FISH for the Y-chromosome and albumin messenger RNA (mRNA) confirmed male-derived cells were mature hepatocytes. These animals had received lethal doses of irradiation at the time of bone marrow transplantation, but this induced no overt, histologically demonstrable, acute hepatic injury, including inflammation, necrosis, oval cell proliferation, or scarring.

The first three are the most widespread.

Thermal biological provides a moderate performance increase over mesophilic digestion, with moderate energetic input. Mechanical treatment methods are comparable, and provide moderate performance improvements with moderate electrical input. Thermal hydrolysis provides substantial performance increases, with a substantial consumption of thermal energy. It is likely that low impact pretreatment methods such as mechanical and thermal phased improve speed of degradation, while high impact methods such as thermal hydrolysis or oxidation improve both speed and extent of degradation.

A laser trap was used to confine the motion of a bead bound to a raft protein to a small area (diam \u2264 100 nm) and to measure its local diffusion by high resolution single particle tracking. Using protein constructs with identical ectodomains and different membrane regions and vice versa, we demonstrate that this method provides the viscous damping of the membrane domain in the lipid bilayer. When glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored and transmembrane proteins are raft-associated, their diffusion becomes independent of the type of membrane anchor and is significantly reduced compared with that of nonraft transmembrane proteins. Cholesterol depletion accelerates the diffusion of raft-associated proteins for transmembrane raft proteins to the level of transmembrane nonraft proteins and for GPI-anchored proteins even further. Raft-associated GPI-anchored proteins were never observed to dissociate from the raft within the measurement intervals of up to 10 min.

    "text":"Net carbon dioxide losses of northern ecosystems in response to autumn warming. An analysis of variations in atmospheric CO2 and ecosystem CO2 fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere shows that warmer autumns have been associated with an earlier autumn-to-winter CO2 build-up in the atmosphere. This seems counter-intuitive: warm autumns surely imply long growing seasons and a beneficial effect on terrestrial carbon sinks as trees and plants make more biomass. An explanation is provided by satellite observations and numerical modelling. Enhanced respiration caused by higher temperatures causes carbon losses that offset photosynthetic gains, limiting the potential of these ecosystems to act as carbon sinks. And CO2 loss due to autumn warming may offset most of the increased CO2 uptake during spring. If future warming occurs more rapidly in autumn than in spring, the ability of northern ecosystems to sequester carbon may diminish more rapidly than previously predicted. The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems is particularly sensitive to climatic changes in autumn and spring1,2,3,4, with spring and autumn temperatures over northern latitudes having risen by about 1.1 \u00b0C and 0.8 \u00b0C, respectively, over the past two decades5. A simultaneous greening trend has also been observed, characterized by a longer growing season and greater photosynthetic activity6,7. These observations have led to speculation that spring and autumn warming could enhance carbon sequestration and extend the period of net carbon uptake in the future8. Here we analyse interannual variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration data and ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes. We find that atmospheric records from the past 20 years show a trend towards an earlier autumn-to-winter carbon dioxide build-up, suggesting a shorter net carbon uptake period. This trend cannot be explained by changes in atmospheric transport alone and, together with the ecosystem flux data, suggest increasing carbon losses in autumn. We use a process-based terrestrial biosphere model and satellite vegetation greenness index observations to investigate further the observed seasonal response of northern ecosystems to autumnal warming. We find that both photosynthesis and respiration increase during autumn warming, but the increase in respiration is greater. In contrast, warming increases photosynthesis more than respiration in spring. Our simulations and observations indicate that northern terrestrial ecosystems may currently lose carbon dioxide in response to autumn warming, with a sensitivity of about 0.2 PgC \u00b0C-1, offsetting 90% of the increased carbon dioxide uptake during spring. If future autumn warming occurs at a faster rate than in spring, the ability of northern ecosystems to sequester carbon may be diminished earlier than previously suggested9,10.",

    "text":"Challenges in Combining Projections from Multiple Climate Models. Abstract Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal\u2014for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models.",

TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades, indicating lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, with closely related enzymes differing in their product profiles, subcellular localization, or the in planta substrates they use.",

    "text":"Cooperative insertion of CO2 in diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks. The process of carbon capture and sequestration has been proposed as a method of mitigating the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If implemented, the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO2 from the effluent stream. There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies, such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as \u2018phase-change\u2019 adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO2 molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO2 separation capacities can be achieved with small temperature swings, and regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable with state-of-the-art aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg2+ within the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase\/oxygenase family of enzymes. A cooperative insertion mechanism for CO2 adsorption is shown to generate highly efficient adsorbents for carbon capture applications. Advanced solid adsorbents are being investigated as potential agents for efficient gas separation technologies that could help make carbon capture technologies more economical. This paper probes the mechanism of carbon dioxide adsorption of a previously reported diamine-appended metal-organic framework. This material demonstrates unusual and potentially practically useful adsorption properties. The authors find that CO2 adsorbs through insertion into the highly stable metal-amine bonds of the metal-organic framework. As a consequence of the homogenous and perfect spacing of amines, as dictated by the framework's topology, the insertion of a single CO2 molecule induces neighbouring sites to also adsorb CO2 in an unprecedented chain reaction process.",

Summary\r\n\r\n1\u2002Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the codominance of two different life forms: grasses and trees. An operational understanding of how these two different life forms coexist is essential for understanding savanna function and for predicting its response to future environmental change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\u2002The existing model, which proposes that grasses and trees coexist by a separation of rooting niches, is not supported by recent empirical investigations. Our aim was to define an alternative mechanism of grass\u2013tree coexistence in savanna ecosystems. The model we have built concentrates on life history\u2013disturbance interactions between grasses and trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\u2002The model demonstrates coexistence for a wide range of environmental conditions, and exhibits long periods of slow decline in adult tree numbers interspersed with relatively infrequent recruitment events. Recruitment is controlled by rainfall, which limits seedling establishment, and fire, which prevents recruitment into adult size classes. Decline in adult tree numbers is the result of continuing, but low levels, of adult mortality. Both aspects of the dynamics are consistent with an established non-equilibrium mechanism of coexistence (the storage effect).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\u2002A sensitivity analysis indicated that data on tree resprouting ability, stem growth rates and the relationship between seedling establishment and wet season drought are essential for predicting both the range of conditions for which coexistence is possible and the response of savanna ecosystems to environmental change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\u2002Our analysis suggests that understanding grass\u2013tree interactions in savanna requires consideration of the long-term effects of life history\u2013disturbance interactions on demography, rather than the fine-scale effects of resource competition on physiological performance.",

Therefore, applications of DFT to systems where dispersion is important have traditionally been of questionable accuracy. However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods.

[1]\u00a0Since iron is an important micronutrient, deposition of iron in mineral aerosols can impact the carbon cycle and atmospheric CO2. This paper reviews our current understanding of the global dust cycle and identifies future research needs. The global distribution of desert dust is estimated from a combination of observations of dust from in situ concentration, optical depth, and deposition data; observations from satellite; and global atmospheric models. The anthropogenically influenced portion of atmospheric desert dust flux is thought to be smaller than the natural portion, but is difficult to quantify due to the poorly understood response of desert dust to changes in climate, land use, and water use. The iron content of aerosols is thought to vary by a factor of 2, while the uncertainty in dust deposition is at least a factor of 10 in some regions due to the high spatial and temporal variability and limited observations. Importantly, we have a limited understanding of the processes by which relatively insoluble soil iron (typically \u223c0.5% is soluble) becomes more soluble (1\u201380%) during atmospheric transport, but these processes could be impacted by anthropogenic emissions of sulfur or organic acids. In order to understand how humans will impact future iron deposition to the oceans, we need to improve our understanding of: iron deposition to remote oceans, iron chemistry in aerosols, how desert dust sources will respond to climate change, and how humans will impact the transport of bioavailable fraction of iron to the oceans.",

These cells are usually culture expanded prior to their application. However, a precise molecular definition of MSC and the sequel of long-term in vitro culture are yet unknown. In this study, we have addressed the impact of replicative senescence on human MSC preparations. Within 43 to 77 days of cultivation (7 to 12 passages), MSC demonstrated morphological abnormalities, enlargement, attenuated expression of specific surface markers, and ultimately proliferation arrest. Adipogenic differentiation potential decreased whereas the propensity for osteogenic differentiation increased. mRNA expression profiling revealed a consistent pattern of alterations in the global gene expression signature of MSC at different passages. These changes are not restricted to later passages, but are continuously acquired with increasing passages. Genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA repair are significantly down-regulated in late passages. Genes from chromosome 4q21 were over-represented among differentially regulated transcripts. Differential expression of 10 genes has been verified in independent donor samples as well as in MSC that were isolated under different culture conditions. Furthermore, miRNA expression profiling revealed an up-regulation of hsa-mir-371, hsa-mir-369-5P, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-499 and hsa-let-7f upon in vitro propagation. Our studies indicate that replicative senescence of MSC preparations is a continuous process starting from the first passage onwards. This process includes far reaching alterations in phenotype, differentiation potential, global gene expression patterns, and miRNA profiles that need to be considered for therapeutic application of MSC preparations.",

    "text":"Continuous change detection and classification of land cover using all available Landsat data. A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating \u201cnoisy\u201d observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%.

    "text":"Effective use of water (EUW) and not water-use efficiency (WUE) is the target of crop yield improvement under drought stress. Water-use efficiency (WUE) is often considered an important determinant of yield under stress and even as a component of crop drought resistance. It has been used to imply that rainfed plant production can be increased per unit water used, resulting in ''more crop per drop''. This opinionated review argues that selection for high WUE in breeding for water-limited conditions will most likely lead, under most conditions, to reduced yield and reduced drought resistance. As long as the biochemistry of photosynthesis cannot be improved genetically, greater genotypic transpiration efficiency (TE) and WUE are driven mainly by plant traits that reduce transpiration and crop water-use, processes which are crucially important for plant production. Since biomass production is tightly linked to transpiration, breeding for maximized soil moisture capture for transpiration is the most important target for yield improvement under drought stress. Effective use of water (EUW) implies maximal soil moisture capture for transpiration which also involves reduced non-stomatal transpiration and minimal water loss by soil evaporation. Even osmotic adjustment which is a major stress adaptive trait in crop plants is recognized as enhancing soil moisture capture and transpiration. High harvest index (HI) expresses successful plant reproduction and yield in terms of reproductive functions and assimilate partitioning towards reproduction. In most rainfed environments crop water deficit develops during the reproductive growth stage thus reducing HI. EUW by way of improving plant water status helps sustain assimilate partitions and reproductive success. It is concluded that EUW is a major target for yield improvement in water-limited environments. It is not a coincidence that EUW is an inverse acronym of WUE because very often high WUE is achieved at the expense of reduced EUW.",

Previously published four case studies on passenger cars, trucks and buses, paper machines and the mining industry were included in our detailed calculations as reference data in our current analyses. The following can be concluded: Fifty years ago, wear and wear-related failures were a major concern for UK industry and their mitigation was considered to be the major contributor to potential economic savings by as much as 95% in ten years by the development and deployment of new tribological solutions. The corresponding estimated savings are today still of the same orders but the calculated contribution to cost reduction is about 74% by friction reduction and to 26% from better wear protection. Overall, wear appears to be more critical than friction as it may result in catastrophic failures and operational breakdowns that can adversely impact productivity and hence cost.",

    "text":"Community assembly and shifts in plant trait distributions across an environmental gradient in coastal California. Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and\/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.",

Data on human kidney cadmium levels identified recently, including the study in our own laboratory, are compared with older studies. Human-tissue cadmium contents showed large variations among individuals, but sources of the variation remain unknown. Exposure levels of 30-50 microg per day have been estimated for adults and these levels have been linked to increased risk of bone fracture, cancer, kidney dysfunction and hypertension. Increased mortality was found among individuals showing signs of cadmium renal toxicity compared with those without such signs, suggesting that renal toxicity may be an early warning of complications, sub-clinical or clinical morbidity.",

Experiments suggest that biodiversity enhances the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage, productivity, and the buildup of nutrient pools (multifunctionality). However, the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality has never been assessed globally in natural ecosystems. We report here on a global empirical study relating plant species richness and abiotic factors to multifunctionality in drylands, which collectively cover 41% of Earth's land surface and support over 38% of the human population. Multifunctionality was positively and significantly related to species richness. The best-fitting models accounted for over 55% of the variation in multifunctionality and always included species richness as a predictor variable. Our results suggest that the preservation of plant biodiversity is crucial to buffer negative effects of climate change and desertification in drylands.",

Excellent agreement of the model predictions with the experimental observations demonstrates that the mechanism is comprehensive and has good predictive capabilities for different experimental systems, including new results published subsequent to the work of Mueller et al. 1, particularly high-pressure laminar flame speed and shock tube ignition results. The reaction H + OH + M is found to be primarily significant only to laminar flame speed propagation predictions at high pressure.

Inhalation studies in vivo and submerse applications in vitro have been described with diverging results. Why some indicate a strong cytotoxicity and some do not is what we report on here. Data from A549 cells incubated with carbon nanotubes fake a strong cytotoxic effect within the MTT assay after 24 h that reaches roughly 50%, whereas the same treatment with SWCNTs, but detection with WST-1, reveals no cytotoxicity. LDH, FACS-assisted mitochondrial membrane potential determination, and Annexin-V\/PI staining also reveal no cytotocicity.

Moreover, we intensely recommend standardizing nanotoxicological assays with regard to the material used: there is a clear need for reference materials.

ABSTRACTDespite a changing world in terms of data sharing, availability, and transparency, there are still major resource issues associated with collating datasets that will satisfy the requirements of comprehensive pesticide risk assessments, especially those undertaken at a regional or national scale.

Over the last 20\u00a0years, this database has been keeping pace with improving risk assessments, their associated data requirements, and the needs and expectations of database end users. In 2007, the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) was launched as a free-to-access website. Currently, the PPDB holds data for almost 2300 pesticide active substances and over 700 metabolites.

The PROPKA method for the prediction of the pK(a) values of ionizable residues in proteins is extended to include the effect of non-proteinaceous ligands on protein pK(a) values as well as predict the change in pK(a) values of ionizable groups on the ligand itself. This new version of PROPKA (PROPKA 2.0) is, as much as possible, developed by adapting the empirical rules underlying PROPKA 1.0 to ligand functional groups. Thus, the speed of PROPKA is retained, so that the pK(a) values of all ionizable groups are computed in a matter of seconds for most proteins. This adaptation is validated by comparing PROPKA 2.0 predictions to experimental data for 26 protein-ligand complexes including trypsin, thrombin, three pepsins, HIV-1 protease, chymotrypsin, xylanase, hydroxynitrile lyase, and dihydrofolate reductase. For trypsin and thrombin, large protonation state changes (|n| > 0.5) have been observed experimentally for 4 out of 14 ligand complexes. PROPKA 2.0 and Klebe's PEOE approach (Czodrowski P et al. J Mol Biol 2007;367:1347-1356) both identify three of the four large protonation state changes. The protonation state changes due to plasmepsin II, cathepsin D and endothiapepsin binding to pepstatin are predicted to within 0.4 proton units at pH 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. The PROPKA 2.0 results indicate that structural changes due to ligand binding contribute significantly to the proton uptake\/release, as do residues far away from the binding site, primarily due to the change in the local environment of a particular residue and hence the change in the local hydrogen bonding network. Overall the results suggest that PROPKA 2.0 provides a good description of the protein-ligand interactions that have an important effect on the pK(a) values of titratable groups, thereby permitting fast and accurate determination of the protonation states of key residues and ligand functional groups within the binding or active site of a protein.",

Here, we propose how to form spin qubits in graphene quantum dots. A crucial requirement to achieve this goal is to find quantum-dot states where the usual valley degeneracy in bulk graphene is lifted. We show that this problem can be avoided in quantum dots based on ribbons of graphene with armchair boundaries. The most remarkable new feature of the proposed spin qubits is that, in an array of many qubits, it is possible to couple any two of them via Heisenberg exchange with the others being decoupled by detuning.

The nodules and associated symbiosomes are structured for efficient nitrogen fixation. Although the interaction is beneficial to both partners, it comes with rigid rules that are strictly enforced by the plant. Entry into root cells requires appropriate recognition of the rhizobial Nod factor signaling molecule, and this recognition activates a series of events, including polarized root-hair tip growth, invagination associated with bacterial infection, and the promotion of cell division in the cortex leading to the nodule meristem. The plant's command of the infection process has been highlighted by its enforcement of terminal differentiation upon the bacteria within nodules of some legumes, and this can result in a loss of bacterial viability while permitting effective nitrogen fixation.

The stationary analysis is performed by using Zivot\u2013Andrews unit root test and the ARDL bounds testing approach for a long run relationship between the series in the presence of structural breaks. The causality between the concerned variables is examined by the VECM Granger causality technique and robustness of causal analysis is tested by innovative accounting approach (IAA). Our results confirm that the variables are cointegrated; it means that the long run relationship exists in the presence of structural breaks. The empirical findings indicate that economic growth and energy consumption increase CO2 emissions, while financial development and trade openness compact it. The VECM causality analysis has shown the feedback hypothesis between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Economic growth and CO2 emissions are also interrelated i.e. bidirectional causality.

Empirical analyses of eco-innovation determinants have rarely been able to distinguish between different areas of environmental impact. The present paper tries to close this gap by employing a new and unique dataset based on the German Community Innovation Survey, conducted in 2009. The main purpose of this paper is to test whether different types of eco-innovation (according to their environmental impacts) are driven by different factors. Beside a complex set of different supply, firm-specific, and demand factors, the literature on determinants of eco-innovation accentuates the important role of regulation, cost savings and customer benefits. We find that current and expected government regulation is particularly important with regard to pushing firms to reduce air (e.g. CO2, SO2 or NOx) as well as water or noise emissions, avoid hazardous substances, and increase recyclability of products. Cost savings are an important motivation for reducing energy and material use, pointing to the role of energy and raw material prices as well as taxation as drivers for eco-innovation. Customer requirements are another important source of eco-innovations, particularly with regard to products with improved environmental performance and process innovations that increase material efficiency, and reduce energy consumption, waste and the use of dangerous substances.

To keep GHGs at manageable levels, large decreases in CO 2 emissions through capturing and separation will be required. This article reviews the possible CO 2 capture and separation technologies for end-of-pipe applications. The three main CO 2 capture technologies discussed include post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion techniques. Various separation techniques, such as chemical absorption, physical absorption, physical adsorption, cryogenics, membrane technology, membranes in conjunction with chemical absorption and chemical-looping combustion (CLC) are also thoroughly discussed. Future directions are suggested for application by oil and gas industry. Sequestration methods, such as geological, mineral carbonation techniques, and ocean dump are not covered in this review.",

Of them, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common phenomenon. These ROS are highly reactive because they can interact with a number of cellular molecules and metabolites thereby leading to a number of destructive processes causing cellular damage. Plants possess to a variable extent antioxidant metabolites, enzymes and non-enzymes, that have the ability to detoxify ROS. In the present review, the emphasis of discussion has been on understanding the role of different antioxidants in plants defense against oxidative stress caused by salt stress. The role of different antioxidants as potential selection criteria for improving plant salt tolerance has been critically discussed. With the advances in molecular biology and availability of advanced genetic tools considerable progress has been made in the past two decades in improving salt-induced oxidative stress tolerance in plants by developing transgenic lines with altered levels of antioxidants of different crops. The potential of this approach in counteracting stress-induced oxidative stress has been discussed at length in this review.",

Multi-temporal change detection is commonly used in the detection of changes to ecosystems. Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events.",

Herein, hierarchical porous O-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) nanotubes (OCN-Tube) are prepared via successive thermal oxidation exfoliation and curling-condensation of bulk g-C3 N4 . The as-prepared OCN-Tube exhibits hierarchically porous structures, which consist of interconnected multiwalled nanotubes with uniform diameters of 20-30 nm. The hierarchical OCN-Tube shows excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under visible light, with methanol evolution rate of 0.88 \u00b5mol g-1 h-1 , which is five times higher than bulk g-C3 N4 (0.17 \u00b5mol g-1 h-1 ). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of OCN-Tube is ascribed to the hierarchical nanotube structure and O-doping effect. The hierarchical nanotube structure endows OCN-Tube with higher specific surface area, greater light utilization efficiency, and improved molecular diffusion kinetics, due to the more exposed active edges and multiple light reflection\/scattering channels. The O-doping optimizes the band structure of g-C3 N4 , resulting in narrower bandgap, greater CO2 affinity, and uptake capacity as well as higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.

Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO2.

By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.",

One critical feedback occurs if C uptake by the biosphere increases in response to the fossil-fuel driven increase in atmospheric [CO 2 ] (\u201cCO 2 fertilization\u201d), thereby slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2 ]. Carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are often first represented in models as net primary productivity (NPP). However, the contribution of CO 2 fertilization to the future global C cycle has been uncertain, especially in forest ecosystems that dominate global NPP, and models that include a feedback between terrestrial biosphere metabolism and atmospheric [CO 2 ] are poorly constrained by experimental evidence. We analyzed the response of NPP to elevated CO 2 (\u2248550 ppm) in four free-air CO 2 enrichment experiments in forest stands. We show that the response of forest NPP to elevated [CO 2 ] is highly conserved across a broad range of productivity, with a stimulation at the median of 23 \u00b1 2%. At low leaf area indices, a large portion of the response was attributable to increased light absorption, but as leaf area indices increased, the response to elevated [CO 2 ] was wholly caused by increased light-use efficiency. The surprising consistency of response across diverse sites provides a benchmark to evaluate predictions of ecosystem and global models and allows us now to focus on unresolved questions about carbon partitioning and retention, and spatial variation in NPP response caused by availability of other growth limiting resources.",

Evidence for the embedding of the atomically dispersed MnN4 moieties within the carbon surface-exposed basal planes was established by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and their dispersion was confirmed by aberration-corrected electron microscopy with atomic resolution.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers in western countries, with a median survival of 6 months and an extremely low percentage of long-term surviving patients. KRAS mutations are known to be a driver event of PDAC, but targeting mutant KRAS has proved challenging. Targeting oncogene-driven signalling pathways is a clinically validated approach for several devastating diseases. Still, despite marked tumour shrinkage, the frequency of relapse indicates that a fraction of tumour cells survives shut down of oncogenic signalling. Here we explore the role of mutant KRAS in PDAC maintenance using a recently developed inducible mouse model of mutated Kras (Kras(G12D), herein KRas) in a p53(LoxP\/WT) background. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of dormant tumour cells surviving oncogene ablation (surviving cells) and responsible for tumour relapse has features of cancer stem cells and relies on oxidative phosphorylation for survival. Transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of surviving cells reveal prominent expression of genes governing mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosome activity, as well as a strong reliance on mitochondrial respiration and a decreased dependence on glycolysis for cellular energetics. Accordingly, surviving cells show high sensitivity to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors, which can inhibit tumour recurrence. Our integrated analyses illuminate a therapeutic strategy of combined targeting of the KRAS pathway and mitochondrial respiration to manage pancreatic cancer.",

Voltage-dependent ion channels contain voltage sensors that allow them to switch between nonconductive and conductive states over the narrow range of a few hundredths of a volt. We investigated the mechanism by which these channels sense cell membrane voltage by determining the x-ray crystal structure of a mammalian Shaker family potassium ion (K + ) channel. The voltage-dependent K + channel Kv1.2 grew three-dimensional crystals, with an internal arrangement that left the voltage sensors in an apparently native conformation, allowing us to reach three important conclusions. First, the voltage sensors are essentially independent domains inside the membrane. Second, they perform mechanical work on the pore through the S4-S5 linker helices, which are positioned to constrict or dilate the S6 inner helices of the pore. Third, in the open conformation, two of the four conserved Arg residues on S4 are on a lipid-facing surface and two are buried in the voltage sensor. The structure offers a simple picture of how membrane voltage influences the open probability of the channel.",

    "text":"Quantifying the biodiversity value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests. Biodiversity loss from deforestation may be partly offset by the expansion of secondary forests and plantation forestry in the tropics. However, our current knowledge of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation is limited to very few taxa, and many studies are severely confounded by methodological shortcomings. We examined the conservation value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests for 15 taxonomic groups using a robust and replicated sample design that minimized edge effects. Different taxa varied markedly in their response to patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage of species restricted to primary forest (varying from 5% to 57%), yet almost all between-forest comparisons showed marked differences in community structure and composition. Cross-taxon congruence in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using abundance or species richness data, but much stronger when using metrics based upon community similarity. Our results show that, whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled (such as birds and fruit-feeding butterflies), it fails for those exhibiting highly idiosyncratic responses to tropical land-use change (including highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees), highlighting the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity value of anthropogenic habitats. Finally, although we show that areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can provide complementary conservation services, we also provide clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of primary forests.",

Treatment of persistent infections is additionally hampered by adaptive resistance, due to the growth state of the bacterium in the patient including the microorganism's ability to grow as a biofilm. An array of P. aeruginosa virulence factors counteract host defences and can cause direct damage to host tissues or increase the bacterium's competitiveness.

This paper presents CO2 flux data from 18 forest ecosystems, studied in the European Union funded EUROFLUX project. Overall, mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP, the total amount of carbon (C) fixed during photosynthesis) of these forests was 1380 \u00b1 330 gC m\u22122 y\u22121 (mean \u00b1SD). On average, 80% of GPP was respired by autotrophs and heterotrophs and released back into the atmosphere (total ecosystem respiration, TER = 1100 \u00b1 260 gC m\u22122 y\u22121). Mean annual soil respiration (SR) was 760 \u00b1 340 gC m\u22122 y\u22121 (55% of GPP and 69% of TER). Among the investigated forests, large differences were observed in annual SR and TER that were not correlated with mean annual temperature. However, a significant correlation was observed between annual SR and TER and GPP among the relatively undisturbed forests. On the assumption that (i) root respiration is constrained by the allocation of photosynthates to the roots, which is coupled to productivity, and that (ii) the largest fraction of heterotrophic soil respiration originates from decomposition of young organic matter (leaves, fine roots), whose availability also depends on primary productivity, it is hypothesized that differences in SR among forests are likely to depend more on productivity than on temperature. At sites where soil disturbance has occurred (e.g. ploughing, drainage), soil espiration was a larger component of the ecosystem C budget and deviated from the relationship between annual SR (and TER) and GPP observed among the less-disturbed forests. At one particular forest, carbon losses from the soil were so large, that in some years the site became a net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Excluding the disturbed sites from the present analysis reduced mean SR to 660 \u00b1 290 gC m\u22122 y\u22121, representing 49% of GPP and 63% of TER in the relatively undisturbed forest ecosystems.",

Abstract The interest in consumption-based emission and resource accounting has grown significantly. Many studies juxtapose consumer emissions (carbon footprint) and producer (territorial) emissions of greenhouse gases in order to demonstrate the effects of trade on the national emission budget. To this end, a respectable number of studies have been undertaken worldwide in order to estimate emissions embedded in international trade of numerous countries and world regions. Input\u2013output approaches, and increasingly multi-region input\u2013output (MRIO) models, are commonly chosen as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for complete carbon footprint estimates at the national and supra-national level. With increasing processing capabilities of computers and a wider availability of economic accounts, environmental accounts and trade data such models are now being implemented on a wide scale. After a brief overview of salient single-region input\u2013output studies I provide an in-depth review of the most recent multi-region input\u2013output models used for the purpose of consumption-based environmental accounting. The main methodological features and important results are described for around twenty studies covering the years 2007 to 2009. This is followed by a detailed review of studies dealing with uncertainty in MRIO analysis, an area which has not received a lot of attention so far. I conclude that further research is mainly needed in two areas, a) improvements in data availability and quality and b) improvements in the accuracy of MRIO modelling.",

In the framework of the ESO Large Programme \u201cFirst Stars\u201d, very high-quality spectra of some 70 very metal-poor dwarfs and giants were obtained with the ESO VLT and UVES spectrograph. These stars are likely to have descended from the first generation(s) of stars formed after the Big Bang, and their detailed composition provides constraints on issues such as the nature of the first supernovae, the efficiency of mixing processes in the early Galaxy, the formation and evolution of the halo of the Galaxy, and the possible sources of reionization of the Universe. This paper presents the abundance analysis of an homogeneous sample of 35 giants selected from the HK survey of Beers et al. ([CITE], [CITE]), emphasizing stars of extremely low metallicity: 30 of our 35 stars are in the range , and 22 stars have . Our new VLT\/UVES spectra, at a resolving power of and with signal-to-noise ratios of 100\u2013200 per pixel over the wavelength range 330\u20131000 nm, are greatly superior to those of the classic studies of McWilliam et al. ([CITE]) and Ryan et al. ([CITE]). The immediate objective of the work is to determine precise, comprehensive, and homogeneous element abundances for this large sample of the most metal-poor giants presently known. In the analysis we combine the spectral line modeling code \u201cTurbospectrum\u201d with OSMARCS model atmospheres, which treat continuum scattering correctly and thus allow proper interpretation of the blue regions of the spectra, where scattering becomes important relative to continuous absorption ( nm). We obtain detailed information on the trends of elemental abundance ratios and the star-to-star scatter around those trends, enabling us to separate the relative contributions of cosmic scatter and observational\/analysis errors. Abundances of 17 elements from C to Zn have been measured in all stars, including K and Zn, which have not previously been detected in stars with [Fe\/H] 3.0. Among the key results, we discuss the oxygen abundance (from the forbidden [OI] line), the different and sometimes complex trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity, the very tight relationship between the abundances of certain elements (e.g., Fe and Cr), and the high [Zn\/Fe] ratio in the most metal-poor stars. Within the error bars, the trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity are consistent with those found in earlier literature, but in many cases the scatter around the average trends is much smaller than found in earlier studies, which were limited to lower-quality spectra. We find that the cosmic scatter in several element ratios may be as low as 0.05 dex. The evolution of the abundance trends and scatter with declining metallicity provides strong constraints on the yields of the first supernovae and their mixing into the early ISM. The abundance ratios found in our sample do not match the predicted yields from pair-instability hypernovae, but are consistent with element production by supernovae with progenitor masses up to 100 .

A minimum kinetic energy difference between the electron and ion maximizes capture; a 1 eV difference reduces capture by 10(3). Thus, in an FTMS ion cell with added electron trapping electrodes, capture appears to be achieved best at the boundary between the potential wells that trap the electrons and ions, now providing 80 +\/- 15% precursor ion conversion efficiency. Capture cross section is dependent on the ionic charge squared (z2), minimizing the secondary dissociation of lower charge fragment ions.

This new relationship reduces unexplained variability in ice nuclei concentrations at a given temperature from approximately 10(3) to less than a factor of 10, with the remaining variability apparently due to variations in aerosol chemical composition or other factors. When implemented in a global climate model, the new parameterization strongly alters cloud liquid and ice water distributions compared to the simple, temperature-only parameterizations currently widely used.

    "text":"Reconciling Carbon-cycle Concepts, Terminology, and Methods. Recent projections of climatic change have focused a great deal of scientific and public attention on patterns of carbon (C) cycling as well as its controls, particularly the factors that determine whether an ecosystem is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Net ecosystem production (NEP), a central concept in C-cycling research, has been used by scientists to represent two different concepts. We propose that NEP be restricted to just one of its two original definitions\u2014the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We further propose that a new term\u2014net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)\u2014be applied to the net rate of C accumulation in (or loss from [negative sign]) ecosystems. Net ecosystem carbon balance differs from NEP when C fluxes other than C fixation and respiration occur, or when inorganic C enters or leaves in dissolved form. These fluxes include the leaching loss or lateral transfer of C from the ecosystem; the emission of volatile organic C, methane, and carbon monoxide; and the release of soot and CO2 from fire. Carbon fluxes in addition to NEP are particularly important determinants of NECB over long time scales. However, even over short time scales, they are important in ecosystems such as streams, estuaries, wetlands, and cities. Recent technological advances have led to a diversity of approaches to the measurement of C fluxes at different temporal and spatial scales. These approaches frequently capture different components of NEP or NECB and can therefore be compared across scales only by carefully specifying the fluxes included in the measurements. By explicitly identifying the fluxes that comprise NECB and other components of the C cycle, such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome production (NBP), we can provide a less ambiguous framework for understanding and communicating recent changes in the global C cycle.",

Novel molecular tools have been constructed which allow for in situ detection of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The reporter responds to AHL activation of LasR by expression of an unstable version of the green-fluorescent protein (Gfp). Gfp-based reporter technology has been applied for non-destructive, single-cell-level detection of quorum sensing in laboratory-based P. aeruginosa biofilms. It is reported that a synthetic halogenated furanone compound, which is a derivative of the secondary metabolites produced by the Australian macroalga Delisea pulchra, is capable of interfering with AHL-mediated quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa. It is demonstrated that the furanone compound specifically represses expression of a PlasB-gfp reporter fusion without affecting growth or protein synthesis. In addition, it reduces the production of important virulence factors, indicating a general effect on target genes of the las quorum sensing circuit. The furanone was applied to P. aeruginosa biofilms established in biofilm flow chambers. The Gfp-based analysis reveals that the compound penetrates microcolonies and blocks cell signalling and quorum sensing in most biofilm cells. The compound did not affect initial attachment to the abiotic substratum. It does, however, affect the architecture of the biofilm and enhances the process of bacterial detachment, leading to a loss of bacterial biomass from the substratum.",

    "text":"The food waste hierarchy as a framework for the management of food surplus and food waste. The unprecedented scale of food waste in global food supply chains is attracting increasing attention due to its environmental, social and economic impacts. Drawing on interviews with food waste specialists, this study construes the boundaries between food surplus and food waste, avoidable and unavoidable food waste, and between waste prevention and waste management. This study suggests that the first step towards a more sustainable resolution of the food waste issue is to adopt a sustainable production and consumption approach and tackle food surplus and waste throughout the global food supply chain. The authors examine the factors that give rise to food waste throughout the food supply chain, and propose a framework to identify and prioritize the most appropriate options for prevention and management of food waste. The proposed framework interprets and applies the waste hierarchy in the context of food waste. It considers the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social), offering a more holistic approach in addressing food waste. Additionally, it considers the materiality and temporality of food. The food waste hierarchy posits that prevention, through minimization of food surplus and avoidable food waste, is the most attractive option. The second most attractive option involves the distribution of food surplus to groups affected by food poverty, followed by the option of converting food waste to animal feed. Although the proposed food waste hierarchy requires a fundamental re-think of the current practices and systems in place, it has the potential to deliver substantial environmental, social and economic benefits.",

The complete, as-designed photocatalysts exhibit excellent activity in CO2 reduction.

In addition, deposition of atom catalysts on g-C3N4 significantly enhances the visible-light absorption, rendering them ideal for visible-light reduction of CO2.

Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO 2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies.",

This Review discusses the evidence supporting dysbiosis in the gut microbiota in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, exploring evidence from animal models and the translation to human disease. A general consensus exists that IBD is associated with compositional and metabolic changes in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). However, a direct causal relationship between dysbiosis and IBD has not been definitively established in humans. Findings from animal models have revealed diverse and context-specific roles of the gut microbiota in health and disease, ranging from protective to pro-inflammatory actions. Moreover, evidence from these experimental models suggest that although gut bacteria often drive immune activation, chronic inflammation in turn shapes the gut microbiota and contributes to dysbiosis. The purpose of this Review is to summarize current associations between IBD and dysbiosis, describe the role of the gut microbiota in the context of specific animal models of colitis, and discuss the potential role of microbiota-focused interventions in the treatment of human IBD. Ultimately, more studies will be needed to define host\u2013microbial relationships relevant to human disease and amenable to therapeutic interventions.",

To address this need the bacterial cellulose (BC) secreted by Gluconacetobacter xylinus (= Acetobacter xylinum) was explored as a novel scaffold material due to its unusual material properties and degradability. Native and chemically modified BC materials were evaluated using bovine chondrocytes. The results indicate that unmodified BC supports chondrocyte proliferation at levels of approximately 50% of the collagen type II substrate while providing significant advantages in terms of mechanical properties. Compared to tissue culture plastic and calcium alginate, unmodified BC showed significantly higher levels of chondrocyte growth. Chemical sulfation and phosphorylation of the BC, performed to mimic the glucosaminoglycans of native cartilage, did not enhance chondrocyte growth while the porosity of the material did affect chondrocyte viability. The BC did not induce significant activation of proinflammatory cytokine production during in vitro macrophage screening. Hence, unmodified BC was further explored using human chondrocytes. TEM analysis and RNA expression of the collagen II from human chondrocytes indicated that unmodified BC supports proliferation of chondrocytes. In addition, ingrowth of chondrocytes into the scaffold was verified by TEM. The results suggest the potential for this biomaterial as a scaffold for tissue engineering of cartilage.",

Given the multiple purposes of many protected areas, measuring effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected areas shows that parks are generally effective at curtailing deforestation within their boundaries. But deforestation in surrounding areas is isolating protected areas. Many initiatives now aim to link protected areas to local socioeconomic development. Some of these initiatives have been successful, but in general expectations need to be tempered regarding the capacity of protected areas to alleviate poverty.

As an example of chemical relevance, the DTNN model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability -- a useful property that is not contained as such in the training dataset.

An analysis of human cancers showed that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Decreasing PHGDH expression impaired proliferation in amplified cell lines. Increased expression was also associated with breast cancer subtypes, and ectopic expression of PHGDH in mammary epithelial cells disrupted acinar morphogenesis and induced other phenotypic alterations that may predispose cells to transformation.

The approach uses a variety of satellite-sensor products to estimate daily evaporation at a global scale and 0.25 degree spatial resolution. Central to this methodology is the use of the Priestley and Taylor (PT) evaporation model. The minimalistic PT equation combines a small number of inputs, the majority of which can be detected from space. This reduces the number of variables that need to be modelled. Key distinguishing features of the approach are the use of microwave-derived soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation density, as well as the detailed estimation of rainfall interception loss. The modelled evaporation is validated against one year of eddy covariance measurements from 43 stations. The estimated annual totals correlate well with the stations' annual cumulative evaporation (R=0.80, N=43) and present a low average bias (\u22125%). The validation of the daily time series at each individual station shows good model performance in all vegetation types and climate conditions with an average correlation coefficient of R=0.83, still lower than the R=0.90 found in the validation of the monthly time series.

Grazing systems persist under marginal bioclimatic and edaphic conditions of different biomes, leading to the emergence of three regional syndromes inherent to global grazing: desertification, woody encroachment, and deforestation. These syndromes have widespread but differential effects on the structure, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and biosphere-atmosphere exchange of grazed ecosystems. In combination, these three syndromes represent a major component of global environmental change.",

    "text":"Chemical and Physical Properties and Potential Mechanisms: Melatonin as a Broad Spectrum Antioxidant and Free Radical Scavenger. Melatonin was found to be a potent free radical scavenger in 1993. Since then over 800 publications have directly or indirectly confirmed this observation. Melatonin scavenges a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species including hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite anion. Based on the analyses of structure-activity relationships, the indole moiety of the melatonin molecule is the reactive center of interaction with oxidants due to its high resonance stability and very low activation energy barrier towards the free radical reactions. However, the methoxy and amide side chains also contribute significantly to melatonin's antioxidant capacity. The N-C=O structure in the C3 amide side chain is the functional group. The carbonyl group in the structure of N-C=O is key for melatonin to scavenge the second reactive species and the nitrogen in the N-C=O structure is necessary for melatonin to form the new five membered ring after melatonin's interaction with a reactive species. The methoxy group in C5 appears to keep melatonin from exhibiting prooxidative activity. If the methoxy group is replaced by a hydroxyl group, under some in vitro conditions, the antioxidant capacity of this molecule may be enhanced. However, the cost of this change are decreased lipophility and increased prooxidative potential. Therefore, in in vivo studies the antioxidant efficacy of melatonin appears to be superior to its hydroxylated counterpart. The mechanisms of melatonin's interaction with reactive species probably involves donation of an electron to form the melatoninyl cation radical or through an radical addition at the site C3. Other possibilities include hydrogen donation from the nitrogen atom or substitution at position C2, C4 and C7 and nitrosation. Melatonin also has the ability to repair damaged biomolecules as shown by the fact that it converts the guanosine radical to guanosine by electron transfer. Unlike the classical antioxidants, melatonin is devoid of prooxidative activity and all known intermediates generated by the interaction of melatonin with reactive species are also free radical scavengers. This phenomenon is defined as the free radical scavenging cascade reaction of the melatonin family. Due to this cascade, one melatonin molecule has the potential to scavenge up to 4 or more reactive species. This makes melatonin very effective as an antioxidant. Under in vivo conditions, melatonin is often several times more potent than vitamin C and E in protecting tissues from oxidative injury when compared at an equivalent dosage (micromol\/kg). Future research in the field of melatonin as a free radical scavenger might be focused on: 1), signal transduction and antioxidant enzyme gene expression induced by melatonin and its metabolites, 2), melatonin levels in tissues and in cells, 3), melatonin structure modifications, 4), melatonin and its metabolites in plants and, 5), clinical trials using melatonin to treat free radical related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke and heart disease.",

We present a calibration of a recently developed filter-based instrument for continuous measurement of light absorption (model PSAP, Radiance Research, Seattle, WA) that has been incorporated in several measurement programs. This calibration uses a reference absorption determined as the difference between light extinction and light scattering by unaltered (suspended) particles.

The culture of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as well as the control of its differentiation toward different tissue lineage, is a very important part of tissue engineering, where cells are combined with artificial scaffold to regenerate tissues. Graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) sheets are soft membranes with high in-plane stiffness and can potentially serve as a biocompatible, transferable, and implantable platform for stem cell culture. While the healthy proliferation of stem cells on various carbon platforms has been demonstrated, the chemical role of G and GO, if any, in guiding uncommitted stem cells toward differentiated cells is not known. Herein, we report that the strong noncovalent binding abilities of G allow it to act as a preconcentration platform for osteogenic inducers, which accelerate MSCs growing on it toward the osteogenic lineage. The molecular origin of accelerated differentation is investigated by studying the binding abilities of G and GO toward different growth agents. Interestingly, differentiation to adipocytes is greatly suppressed on G because insulin, which is a key regulator for the synthesis of fatty acids, is denatured upon \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 adsorption on G; in contrast, GO does not interfere with adipogenesis due to electrostatic binding with insulin.

    "text":"A global simulation of tropospheric ozone and related tracers: Description and evaluation of MOZART, version 2. [1]\u00a0We have developed a global three-dimensional chemical transport model called Model of Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART), version 2. This model, which will be made available to the community, is built on the framework of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH) and can easily be driven with various meteorological inputs and model resolutions. In this work, we describe the standard configuration of the model, in which the model is driven by meteorological inputs every 3 hours from the middle atmosphere version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (MACCM3) and uses a 20-min time step and a horizontal resolution of 2.8\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 2.8\u00b0 longitude with 34 vertical levels extending up to approximately 40 km. The model includes a detailed chemistry scheme for tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbon chemistry, with 63 chemical species. Tracer advection is performed using a flux-form semi-Lagrangian scheme with a pressure fixer. Subgrid-scale convective and boundary layer parameterizations are included in the model. Surface emissions include sources from fossil fuel combustion, biofuel and biomass burning, biogenic and soil emissions, and oceanic emissions. Parameterizations of dry and wet deposition are included. Stratospheric concentrations of several long-lived species (including ozone) are constrained by relaxation toward climatological values. The distribution of tropospheric ozone is well simulated in the model, including seasonality and horizontal and vertical gradients. However, the model tends to overestimate ozone near the tropopause at high northern latitudes. Concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitric acid (HNO3) agree well with observed values, but peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) is overestimated by the model in the upper troposphere at several locations. Carbon monoxide (CO) is simulated well at most locations, but the seasonal cycle is underestimated at some sites in the Northern Hemisphere. We find that in situ photochemical production and loss dominate the tropospheric ozone budget, over input from the stratosphere and dry deposition. Approximately 75% of the tropospheric production and loss of ozone occurs within the tropics, with large net production in the tropical upper troposphere. Tropospheric production and loss of ozone are three to four times greater in the northern extratropics than the southern extratropics. The global sources of CO consist of photochemical production (55%) and direct emissions (45%). The tropics dominate the chemistry of CO, accounting for about 75% of the tropospheric production and loss. The global budgets of tropospheric ozone and CO are generally consistent with the range found in recent studies. The lifetime of methane (9.5 years) and methylchloroform (5.7 years) versus oxidation by tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH), two useful measures of the global abundance of OH, agree well with recent estimates. Concentrations of nonmethane hydrocarbons and oxygenated intermediates (carbonyls and peroxides) generally agree well with observations.",

    "text":"Sintering of Catalytic Nanoparticles: Particle Migration or Ostwald Ripening?. Metal nanoparticles contain the active sites in heterogeneous catalysts, which are important for many industrial applications including the production of clean fuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and the cleanup of exhaust from automobiles and stationary power plants. Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is an important mechanism for the loss of catalyst activity. This is especially true for high temperature catalytic processes, such as steam reforming, automotive exhaust treatment, or catalytic combustion. With dwindling supplies of precious metals and increasing demand, fundamental understanding of catalyst sintering is very important for achieving clean energy and a clean environment, and for efficient chemical conversion processes with atom selectivity. Scientists have proposed two mechanisms for sintering of nanoparticles: particle migration and coalescence (PMC) and Ostwald ripening (OR). PMC involves the mobility of particles in a Brownian-like motion on the support surface, with subsequent coalescence leading to nanoparticle growth. In contrast, OR involves the migration of adatoms or mobile molecular species, driven by differences in free energy and local adatom concentrations on the support surface. In this Account, we divide the process of sintering into three phases. Phase I involves rapid loss in catalyst activity (or surface area), phase II is where sintering slows down, and phase III is where the catalyst may reach a stable performance. Much of the previous work is based on inferences from catalysts that were observed before and after long term treatments. While the general phenomena can be captured correctly, the mechanisms cannot be determined. Advancements in the techniques of in situ TEM allow us to observe catalysts at elevated temperatures under working conditions. We review recent evidence obtained via in situ methods to determine the relative importance of PMC and OR in each of these phases of catalyst sintering. The evidence suggests that, in phase I, OR is responsible for the rapid loss of activity that occurs when particles are very small. Surprisingly, very little PMC is observed in this phase. Instead, the rapid loss of activity is caused by the disappearance of the smallest particles. These findings are in good agreement with representative atomistic simulations of sintering. In phase II, sintering slows down since the smallest particles have disappeared. We now see a combination of PMC and OR, but do not fully understand the relative contribution of each of these processes to the overall rates of sintering. In phase III, the particles have grown large and other parasitic phenomena, such as support restructuring, can become important, especially at high temperatures. Examining the evolution of particle size and surface area with time, we do not see a stable or equilibrium state, especially for catalysts operating at elevated temperatures. In conclusion, the recent literature, especially on in situ studies, shows that OR is the dominant process causing the growth of nanoparticle size. Consequently, this leads to the loss of surface area and activity. While particle migration could be controlled through suitable structuring of catalyst supports, it is more difficult to control the mobility of atomically dispersed species. These insights into the mechanisms of sintering could help to develop sinter-resistant catalysts, with the ultimate goal of designing catalysts that are self-healing.",

Although the biological effects of some nanomaterials have already been assessed, information on toxicity and possible mechanisms of various particle types are insufficient. Moreover, the role of particle properties in the toxic reaction remains to be fully understood. In this paper, we aimed to explore the interrelationship between particle size, shape, chemical composition and toxicological effects of four typical nanomaterials with comparable properties: carbon black (CB), single wall carbon nanotube, silicon dioxide (SiO2) and zinc dioxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. We investigated the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative effects of particles on primary mouse embryo fibroblast cells. As observed in the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and water-soluble tetrazolium (WST) assays, ZnO induced much greater cytotoxicity than non-metal nanoparticles. This was significantly in accordance with intracellular oxidative stress levels measured by glutathione depletion, malondialdehyde production, superoxide dismutase inhibition as well as reactive oxygen species generation. The results indicated that oxidative stress may be a key route in inducing the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles. Compared with ZnO nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes were moderately cytotoxic but induced more DNA damage determined by the comet assay. CB and SiO2 seemed to be less effective. The comparative analysis demonstrated that particle composition probably played a primary role in the cytotoxic effects of different nanoparticles. However, the potential genotoxicity might be mostly attributed to particle shape. Copyright \u00a9 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Abstract The physical climate formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled carbon\u2013climate Earth System Models, ESM2M and ESM2G, are described. These models demonstrate similar climate fidelity as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory\u2019s previous Climate Model version 2.1 (CM2.1) while incorporating explicit and consistent carbon dynamics. The two models differ exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 with vertical pressure layers while ESM2G uses Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. Differences in the ocean mean state include the thermocline depth being relatively deep in ESM2M and relatively shallow in ESM2G compared to observations. The crucial role of ocean dynamics on climate variability is highlighted in El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation being overly strong in ESM2M and overly weak in ESM2G relative to observations. Thus, while ESM2G might better represent climate changes relating to total heat content variability given its lack of long-term drift, gyre circulation, and ventilation in the North Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and depth structure in the overturning and abyssal flows, ESM2M might better represent climate changes relating to surface circulation given its superior surface temperature, salinity, and height patterns, tropical Pacific circulation and variability, and Southern Ocean dynamics. The overall assessment is that neither model is fundamentally superior to the other, and that both models achieve sufficient fidelity to allow meaningful climate and earth system modeling applications. This affords the ability to assess the role of ocean configuration on earth system interactions in the context of two state-of-the-art coupled carbon\u2013climate models.",

    "text":"Why is the partial oxygen pressure of human tissues a crucial parameter? Small molecules and hypoxia. Oxygen supply and diffusion into tissues are necessary for survival. The oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), which is a key component of the physiological state of an organ, results from the balance between oxygen delivery and its consumption. In mammals, oxygen is transported by red blood cells circulating in a well-organized vasculature. Oxygen delivery is dependent on the metabolic requirements and functional status of each organ. Consequently, in a physiological condition, organ and tissue are characterized by their own unique 'tissue normoxia' or 'physioxia' status. Tissue oxygenation is severely disturbed during pathological conditions such as cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, etc., which are associated with decrease in pO(2), i.e. 'hypoxia'. In this review, we present an array of methods currently used for assessing tissue oxygenation. We show that hypoxia is marked during tumour development and has strong consequences for oxygenation and its influence upon chemotherapy efficiency. Then we compare this to physiological pO(2) values of human organs. Finally we evaluate consequences of physioxia on cell activity and its molecular modulations. More importantly we emphasize the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro tissue and cells oxygen status which can have detrimental effects on experimental outcome. It appears that the values corresponding to the physioxia are ranging between 11% and 1% O(2) whereas current in vitro experimentations are usually performed in 19.95% O(2), an artificial context as far as oxygen balance is concerned. It is important to realize that most of the experiments performed in so-called normoxia might be dangerously misleading.",

One of the aims of research in coral reef biology is to discern and describe quantitatively the adaptations that permit reef communities to exploit a marginally suitable habitat. Vital to this aim is an understanding of the nutrition of corals themselves since these lime-secreting cnidarians are the dominant life forms of many reefs and one of the principal reef builders. The general topic of coral nutrition has been reviewed recently (Muscatine 1973, Taylor 1973a) and serves as a convenient point of departure. The present discussion considers the potential nutritional capabilities of corals as mutualistic symbioses and the extent to which specific organismic and ecological manifestations of these capabilities have been described and quantified.",

Recent improvements to the authors' three dimensional radiative transfer model of a vegetated surface are described. Example simulation results and a validation exercise are discussed. The model was utilized to derive land cover specific NDVI-LAI and NDVI-FAPAR relations.

After a survey of the kinds of models that have been applied to this problem, a strategy is suggested for building simple, physically motivated models, and a time-dependent model is developed that simulates the history of planetary glaciation for the past 500,000 years.

Via excretory processes, animals can supply nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) at rates comparable to major nutrient sources, and nutrient cycling by animals can support a substantial proportion of the nutrient demands of primary producers. In addition, animals may exert strong impacts on the species composition of primary producers via effects on nutrient supply rates and ratios. Animals can either recycle nutrients within a habitat, or translocate nutrients across habitats or ecosystems. Nutrient translocation by relatively large animals may be particularly important for stimulating new primary production and for increasing nutrient standing stocks in recipient habitats. Animals also have numerous indirect effects on nutrient fluxes via effects on their prey or by modification of the physical environment. Future studies must quantify how the importance of animal-mediated nutrient cycling varies among taxa and along environmental gradients such as ecosystem size and productivity.",

Abstract Background Curcumin, a yellow polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of turmeric ( Curcuma longa ), has potent anti-cancer properties as demonstrated in a plethora of human cancer cell line and animal carcinogenesis models. Nevertheless, widespread clinical application of this relatively efficacious agent in cancer and other diseases has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility, and consequently, minimal systemic bioavailability. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery approaches have the potential for rendering hydrophobic agents like curcumin dispersible in aqueous media, thus circumventing the pitfalls of poor solubility. Results We have synthesized polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated formulation of curcumin \u2013 nanocurcumin \u2013 utilizing the micellar aggregates of cross-linked and random copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM), with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) and poly(ethyleneglycol)monoacrylate (PEG-A). Physico-chemical characterization of the polymeric nanoparticles by dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electron microscopy confirms a narrow size distribution in the 50 nm range. Nanocurcumin, unlike free curcumin, is readily dispersed in aqueous media. Nanocurcumin demonstrates comparable in vitro therapeutic efficacy to free curcumin against a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, as assessed by cell viability and clonogenicity assays in soft agar. Further, nanocurcumin's mechanisms of action on pancreatic cancer cells mirror that of free curcumin, including induction of cellular apoptosis, blockade of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) activation, and downregulation of steady state levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1). Conclusion Nanocurcumin provides an opportunity to expand the clinical repertoire of this efficacious agent by enabling ready aqueous dispersion. Future studies utilizing nanocurcumin are warranted in pre-clinical in vivo models of cancer and other diseases that might benefit from the effects of curcumin.",

The need to characterize nanoparticles in solution before assessing the in vitro toxicity is a high priority. Particle size, size distribution, particle morphology, particle composition, surface area, surface chemistry, and particle reactivity in solution are important factors which need to be defined to accurately assess nanoparticle toxicity. Currently, there are no well-defined techniques for characterization of wet nanomaterials in aqueous or biological solutions. Previously reported nanoparticle characterization techniques in aqueous or biological solutions have consisted of the use of ultra-high illumination light microscopy and disc centrifuge sedimentation; however, these techniques are limited by the measurement size range. The current study focuses on characterizing a wide range of nanomaterials using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy, including metals, metal oxides, and carbon-based materials, in water and cell culture media, with and without serum. Cell viability and cell morphology studies were conducted in conjunction with DLS experiments to evaluate toxicological effects from observed agglomeration changes in the presence or absence of serum in cell culture media. Observations of material-specific surface properties were also recorded. It was also necessary to characterize the impact of sonication, which is implemented to aid in particle dispersion and solution mixture. Additionally, a stock solution of nanomaterials used for toxicology studies was analyzed for changes in agglomeration and zeta potential of the material over time. In summary, our results demonstrate that many metal and metal oxide nanomaterials agglomerate in solution and that depending upon the solution particle agglomeration is either agitated or mitigated. Corresponding toxicity data revealed that the addition of serum to cell culture media can, in some cases, have a significant effect on particle toxicity possibly due to changes in agglomeration or surface chemistry. It was also observed that sonication slightly reduces agglomeration and has minimal effect on particle surface charge. Finally, the stock solution experienced significant changes in particle agglomeration and surface charge over time.",

Motor vehicle emissions usually constitute the most significant source of ultrafine particles (diameter <0.1 microm) in an urban environment, yet little is known about the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways. In the present study, particle number concentration and size distribution in the size range from 6 to 220 nm were measured by a condensation particle counter (CPC) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), respectively. Measurements were taken 30, 60, 90, 150, and 300 m downwind, and 300 m upwind, from Interstate 405 at the Los Angeles National Cemetery. At each sampling location, concentrations of CO, black carbon (BC), and particle mass were also measured by a Dasibi CO monitor, an aethalometer, and a DataRam, respectively. The range of average concentration of CO, BC, total particle number, and mass concentration at 30 m was 1.7-2.2 ppm, 3.4-10.0 microg\/m3, 1.3-2.0 x 10(5)\/cm3, and 30.2-64.6 microg\/m3, respectively. For the conditions of these measurements, relative concentrations of CO, BC, and particle number tracked each other well as distance from the freeway increased. Particle number concentration (6-220 nm) decreased exponentially with downwind distance from the freeway. Data showed that both atmospheric dispersion and coagulation contributed to the rapid decrease in particle number concentration and change in particle size distribution with increasing distance from the freeway. Average traffic flow during the sampling periods was 13,900 vehicles\/hr. Ninety-three percent of vehicles were gasoline-powered cars or light trucks. The measured number concentration tracked traffic flow well. Thirty meters downwind from the freeway, three distinct ultrafine modes were observed with geometric mean diameters of 13, 27, and 65 nm. The smallest mode, with a peak concentration of 1.6 x 10(5)\/cm3, disappeared at distances greater than 90 m from the freeway. Ultrafine particle number concentration measured 300 m downwind from the freeway was indistinguishable from upwind background concentration.

Despite increasing attention to the human dimension of conservation projects, a rigorous, systematic methodology for planning for ecosystem services has not been developed. This is in part because flows of ecosystem services remain poorly characterized at local-to-regional scales, and their protection has not generally been made a priority. We used a spatially explicit conservation planning framework to explore the trade-offs and opportunities for aligning conservation goals for biodiversity with six ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood control, forage production, outdoor recreation, crop pollination, and water provision) in the Central Coast ecoregion of California, United States. We found weak positive and some weak negative associations between the priority areas for biodiversity conservation and the flows of the six ecosystem services across the ecoregion. Excluding the two agriculture-focused services\u2014crop pollination and forage production\u2014eliminates all negative correlations. We compared the degree to which four contrasting conservation network designs protect biodiversity and the flow of the six services. We found that biodiversity conservation protects substantial collateral flows of services. Targeting ecosystem services directly can meet the multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity goals more efficiently but cannot substitute for targeted biodiversity protection (biodiversity losses of 44% relative to targeting biodiversity alone). Strategically targeting only biodiversity plus the four positively associated services offers much promise (relative biodiversity losses of 7%). Here we present an initial analytical framework for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in conservation planning and illustrate its application. We found that although there are important potential trade-offs between conservation for biodiversity and for ecosystem services, a systematic planning framework offers scope for identifying valuable synergies.",

Concern over the impact of anthropogenic carbon emissions on the global climate has increased in recent years due to growth in global warming awareness. Approximately 5% of global CO2 emissions originate from the manufacturing of cement, the third largest source of carbon emission in the United States. In addition to the generation of CO2 the cement manufacturing process produces millions of tons of the waste product cement kiln dust (CKD) each year contributing to respiratory and pollution health risks. In this paper LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impact of four cement manufacturing processes: (1) the production of traditional Portland cement, (2) blended cement (natural pozzolans), (3) cement where 100% of waste cement kiln dust is recycled into the kiln process, and (4) Portland cement produced when cement kiln dust (CKD) is used to sequester a portion of the process related CO2 emissions. To reduce uncertainty this manuscript presents a cradle-to-gate life-cycle assessment of several cement products. Analysis using SimaPro 6.0 software shows that blended cements provide the greatest environmental savings followed by utilization of CKD for sequestration. The recycling of CKD was found to have little environmental savings over the traditional process.",

Heck in the late sixties, has been a topic of fluctuating interest; however, in the last six years activity in this area has flourished. Careful choice of substrates and skillful tailoring of reaction conditions lead to impressive sequences consisting of even different reaction types that occur not only in a consecutive mode, but also in a single operation. The wellestablished Heck reaction, together with other mechanistically related palladiumcatalyzed transformations with arene, alkene, and alkyne derivatives, opens the door to a tremendous variety of elegant and highly convergent routes to structurally complex molecules. The reaction is not disturbed by heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen (nor by sulfur and phosphorus with some limitations). The spectrum of recent achievements starts with a range of chemoselective and regioselective monocouplings of highly functionalized substrates with unsymmetrical and multisubstituted reaction partners. Other advances include cascade reactions in which three, four, five, and even eight new CC bonds are formed to yield oligofunctional and oligocyclic products with impressive molecular complexity. Even the enantioselective construction of complex natural products with quaternary stereocenters has been achieved with Heck reactions in key steps, as exemplified by the synthesis of crinan, picrotoxinin, and morphine. Today, the Heck reaction is indispensible in the arsenal of synthetic methods available to organic chemists. Certainly it is only a matter of time before the Heck reaction is applied in industrial syntheses.",

Global threats of fuel shortages in the near future and climate change due to green-house gas emissions are posing serious challenges and hence and it is imperative to explore means for sustainable ways of averting the consequences. The dual application of microalgae for phycoremediation and biomass production for sustainable biofuels production is a feasible option. The use of high rate algal ponds (HRAPs) for nutrient removal has been in existence for some decades though the technology has not been fully harnessed for wastewater treatment. Therefore this paper discusses current knowledge regarding wastewater treatment using HRAPs and microalgal biomass production techniques using wastewater streams. The biomass harvesting methods and lipid extraction protocols are discussed in detail.

We have examined some subtle parameter modifications to the Cornell et al. force field, which has proven quite successful in reproducing nucleic acid properties, but whose C2'-endo sugar pucker phase and helical repeat for B DNA appear to be somewhat underestimated. Encouragingly, the addition of a single V2 term involving the atoms C(sp3)-O-(sp3)-C(sp3)-N(sp2), which can be nicely rationalized because of the anomeric effect (lone pairs on oxygen are preferentially oriented relative to the electron withdrawing N), brings the sugar pucker phase of C2'-endo sugars to near perfect agreement with ab initio calculations (W near 162 degrees). Secondly, the use of high level ab initio calculations on entire nucleosides (in contrast to smaller model systems necessitated in 1994-95 by computer limitations) lets one improve the chi torsional potential for nucleic acids. Finally, the O(sp3)-C(sp3)- C(sp3)-O(sp3) V2 torsional potential has been empirically adjusted to reproduce the ab initio calculated relative energy of C2'-endo and C3'-endo nucleosides. These modifications are tested in molecular dynamics simulations of mononucleosides (to assess sugar pucker percentages) and double helices of DNA and RNA (to assess helical and sequence specific structural properties).

Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of &gt;900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from &gt;60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As N availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity.",

Abstract Engineering photocatalytic materials for renewable energy generation and environmental decontamination has always been a very exciting prospect to counter the global energy demands and pollution challenges. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ), a polymeric, metal-free semiconductor with a mild band gap (2.7\u00a0eV) has become hot-spot in various scientific exploits such as environmental pollution mitigation, energy generation and storage, organic synthesis, sensors, etc. These applications exploit the interesting properties of g-C 3 N 4 such as good visible light absorption, graphene-like structure, good thermal and chemical stability and photocatalytic properties. In this review we begin with an overview of the fundamental aspects of photocatalysis as a pollution remediation strategy. This is followed by an introduction to graphitic carbon nitride as a photocatalyst, preparation strategies and its properties. Subsequently, a comprehensive and critical discussion of the various most recent developments towards enhancing the visible light photocatalytic properties of g-C 3 N 4 for pollution alleviation, selected results and important photocatalytic degradation mechanisms, is given.

Focussing on the UK Government's policy for a low carbon transition, the paper provides a conceptual language with which to describe and assess the geographical implications of a transition towards low carbon energy. Six concepts are introduced and explained: location, landscape, territoriality, spatial differentiation, scaling, and spatial embeddedness. Examples illustrate how the geographies of a future low-carbon economy are not yet determined and that a range of divergent \u2013 and contending \u2013 potential geographical futures are in play. More attention to the spaces and places that transition to a low-carbon economy will produce can help better understand what living in a low-carbon economy will be like.

As one important component of sulfur cathodes, the carbon host plays a key role in the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this paper, a mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (MPNC)-sulfur nanocomposite is reported as a novel cathode for advanced Li-S batteries. The nitrogen doping in the MPNC material can effectively promote chemical adsorption between sulfur atoms and oxygen functional groups on the carbon, as verified by X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, and the mechanism by which nitrogen enables the behavior is further revealed by density functional theory calculations. Based on the advantages of the porous structure and nitrogen doping, the MPNC-sulfur cathodes show excellent cycling stability (95% retention within 100 cycles) at a high current density of 0.7 mAh cm-2 with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg S cm-2) and a sulfur content (70 wt%). A high areal capacity (\u22483.3 mAh cm-2) is demonstrated by using the novel cathode, which is crucial for the practical application of Li-S batteries. It is believed that the important role of nitrogen doping promoted chemical adsorption can be extended for development of other high performance carbon-sulfur composite cathodes for Li-S batteries.",

This study was designed to evaluate whether calcium deposition in the coronary arteries is related to atherosclerotic plaque burden and narrowing of the arterial lumen.Many studies have recently documented the feasibility of electron beam computed tomography to detect and quantify coronary artery calcification in patients. Although these studies suggest a general relation between calcification and severity of coronary artery disease, the value of coronary calcium in defining atherosclerotic plaque and coronary lumen narrowing is unclear. Previous pathologic comparisons have failed to detail such a relation in identical histologic sections. This finding may be due to atherosclerotic remodeling.A total of 37 nondecalcified coronary arteries were processed, sectioned at 3-mm intervals (723 sections) and evaluated by computer planimetry and densitometry.A significant relation between calcium area and plaque area was found on a per-heart basis (n = 13, r = 0.87, p < 0.0001), per-artery basis (left anterior descending coronary artery [LAD]: n = 13, r = 0.89, p < 0.0001; left circumflex coronary artery [LCx]: n = 11, r = 0.7, p < 0.001; right coronary artery [RCA]: n = 13, r = 0.89, p < 0.0001) and per-segment basis (n = 723, r = 0.52, p < 0.0001). In contrast, a poor relation existed between residual histologic lumen area and calcium area for individual hearts (r = 0.48, p = NS), individual coronary arteries (LAD: r = 0.59, p = NS; LCx: r = 0.10, p = NS; RCA: r = 0.59, p = NS) and coronary segments (r = 0.07, p = NS). Longitudinal changes in external elastic lamina areas were highly correlated with changes in plaque area values (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001), whereas lumen area did not correlate with plaque size change (r = 0.01, p = NS).Coronary calcium quantification is an excellent method of assessing atherosclerotic plaque presence at individual artery sites. Moreover, the amount of calcium correlates with the overall magnitude of atherosclerotic plaque burden. This study suggests that the remodeling phenomenon is the likely explanation for the lack of a good predictive value between lumen narrowing and quantification of mural calcification.",

Expression of the tumour suppressor PTEN in disseminated primary tumour cells is lost after tumour cells metastasize to the brain, with downregulation instigated by microRNAs from astrocytes, which are transferred from cell to cell by exosomes; these findings reveal the dynamic nature of metastatic cancer cells when adapting to a new tissue environment. Post-metastasis, cancer cells of common origin need to activate distinct gene expression patterns in order to adapt to a new environment. However, it is not clear when and how these adaptations to the microenvironment occur. Here, Dihua Yu and colleagues determine that tumor cell expression of the PTEN tumour suppressor is lost when these invading cells enter the brain. Downregulation of PTEN is instigated by astrocytic microRNAs, which are transferred from cell to cell through exosomes. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of metastatic cancer cells when adapting to a new tissue environment. The development of life-threatening cancer metastases at distant organs requires disseminated tumour cells\u2019 adaptation to, and co-evolution with, the drastically different microenvironments of metastatic sites1. Cancer cells of common origin manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different organs2. Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the subsequent metastatic outgrowth3,4. Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes. Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of consequence for brain metastasis patients.",

The model is tested using a meta-analytical structural equation modelling approach based on a pool of 56 different data sets with a variety of target behaviours. The model is supported by the data. Intentions to act, perceived behavioural control and habits were identified as direct predictors of behaviour. Intentions are predicted by attitudes, personal and social norms, and perceived behavioural control. Personal norms are predicted by social norms, perceived behavioural control, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, an ecological world view and self-transcendence values. Self-enhancement values have a negative impact on personal norms. Based on the model, interventions to change behaviour need not only to include attitude campaigns but also a focus on de-habitualizing behaviour, strengthening the social support and increasing self-efficacy by concrete information about how to act.

However, their possible biomedical applications have rarely been considered, especially the cancer phototherapeutic applications in both the first and second near-infrared light (NIR-I and NIR-II) biowindows. In this work, we explore, for the first time as far as we know, a novel kind of 2D niobium carbide (Nb2C), MXene, with highly efficient in vivo photothermal ablation of mouse tumor xenografts in both NIR-I and NIR-II windows. The 2D Nb2C nanosheets (NSs) were fabricated by a facile and scalable two-step liquid exfoliation method combining stepwise delamination and intercalation procedures. The ultrathin, lateral-nanosized Nb2C NSs exhibited extraordinarily high photothermal conversion efficiency (36.4% at NIR-I and 45.65% at NIR-II), as well as high photothermal stability. The Nb2C NSs intrinsically feature unique enzyme-responsive biodegradability to human myeloperoxidase, low phototoxicity, and high biocompatibility. Especially, these surface-engineered Nb2C NSs present highly efficient in vivo photothermal ablation and eradication of tumor in both NIR-I and NIR-II biowindows.

I explore current levels of non-structural carbon in trees in natural forests in order to estimate the potential for a carbon-driven stimulation of growth. 2 The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in tree tissues is considered a measure of carbon shortage or surplus for growth. A periodic reduction of NSC pools indicates either that carbon demand exceeds con-current supply, or that both source and sink activity are low. A steady, very high NSC concentration is likely to indicate that photosynthesis fully meets, or even exeeds, that needed for growth (surplus assimilates accumulate). 3 The analysis presented here considers data for mature trees in four climatic zones: the high elevation treeline (in Mexico, the Alps and Northern Sweden), a temperate lowland forest of central Europe, Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland and a semideciduous tropical forest in Panama. 4 In all four climatic regions, periods of reduced or zero growth show maximum C-loading of trees (source activity exceeding demand), except for dry midsummer in the Mediterranean. NSC pools are generally high throughout the year, and are not significantly affected by mass fruiting episodes. 5 It is concluded that, irrespective of the reason for its periodic cessation, growth does not seem to be limited by carbon supply. Instead, in all the cases examined, sink activity and its direct control by the environment or developmental constraints, restricts biomass production of trees under current ambient CO2 concentrations. 6 The current carbohydrate charging of mature wild trees from the tropics to the cold limit of tree growth suggests that little (if any) leeway exists for further CO2-fertilization effects on growth.",

Some of these are independently assured and assurers may or may not be from the auditing profession. We seek to understand this emerging voluntary assurance market. Using a sample of 2,113 companies (from 31 countries) that produced sustainability reports between 2002\u20132004, we use sequential logit analysis to identify the factors associated with the decision to voluntarily purchase assurance and the choice of assurance provider. We hypothesize that a company's need to enhance credibility through assurance and choice of assurance provider will be a function of company-, industry-, and country-related factors. Our results support the argument that companies seeking to enhance the credibility of their reports and build their corporate reputation are more likely to have their sustainability reports assured, although it does not matter whether the assurance provider comes from the auditing profession. We also find that companies operating in stakeholder-orientated countries are more likely to choose the auditing profession as an assurer.",

Subphenotypes have been identified within heterogeneous diseases such as asthma and breast cancer, with important therapeutic implications. We assessed whether subphenotypes exist within acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), another heterogeneous disorder.We used data from two ARDS randomised controlled trials (ARMA trial and ALVEOLI trial), sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. We applied latent class modelling to identify subphenotypes using clinical and biological data. We modelled data from both studies independently. We then tested the association of subphenotypes with clinical outcomes in both cohorts and with the response to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the ALVEOLI cohort.We analysed data for 1022 patients: 473 in the ARMA cohort and 549 in the ALVEOLI cohort. Independent latent class models indicated that a two-class (ie, two subphenotype) model was the best fit for both cohorts. In both cohorts, we identified a hyperinflammatory subphenotype (phenotype 2) that was characterised by higher plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, a higher prevalence of vasopressor use, lower serum bicarbonate concentrations, and a higher prevalence of sepsis than phenotype 1. Participants in phenotype 2 had higher mortality and fewer ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days in both cohorts than did those in phenotype 1 (p<0\u00b7007 for all). In the ALVEOLI cohort, the effects of ventilation strategy (high PEEP vs low PEEP) on mortality, ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days differed by phenotype (p=0\u00b7049 for mortality, p=0\u00b7018 for ventilator-free days, p=0\u00b7003 for organ-failure-free days).We have identified two subphenotypes within ARDS, one of which is categorised by more severe inflammation, shock, and metabolic acidosis and by worse clinical outcomes. Response to treatment in a randomised trial of PEEP strategies differed on the basis of subphenotype. Identification of ARDS subphenotypes might be useful in selecting patients for future clinical trials.National Institutes of Health.",

Gene therapy has become a promising strategy for the treatment of many inheritable or acquired diseases that are currently considered incurable. Non-viral vectors have attracted great interest, as they are simple to prepare, rather stable, easy to modify and relatively safe, compared to viral vectors. Unfortunately, they also suffer from a lower transfection efficiency, requiring additional effort for their optimization. The cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) has been widely used for non-viral transfection in vitro and in vivo and has an advantage over other polycations in that it combines strong DNA compaction capacity with an intrinsic endosomolytic activity. Here, we give some insight into strategies developed for PEI-based non-viral vectors to overcome intracellular obstacles, including the improvement of methods for polyplex preparation and the incorporation of endosomolytic agents or nuclear localization signals. In recent years, PEI-based non-viral vectors have been locally or systemically delivered, mostly to target gene delivery to tumor tissue, the lung or liver. This requires strategies to efficiently shield transfection polyplexes against non-specific interaction with blood components, extracellular matrix and untargeted cells and the attachment of targeting moieties, which allow for the directed gene delivery to the desired cell or tissue. In this context, materials, facilitating the design of novel PEI-based non-viral vectors are described.",

The majority of patients with cancer undergo at least one surgical procedure as part of their treatment. Severe postsurgical infection is associated with adverse oncologic outcomes; however, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils, which function as the first line of defense during infections, facilitate cancer progression. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular neutrophil-derived DNA webs released in response to inflammatory cues that trap and kill invading pathogens. The role of NETs in cancer progression is entirely unknown. We report that circulating tumor cells become trapped within NETs in vitro under static and dynamic conditions. In a murine model of infection using cecal ligation and puncture, we demonstrated microvascular NET deposition and consequent trapping of circulating lung carcinoma cells within DNA webs. NET trapping was associated with increased formation of hepatic micrometastases at 48 hours and gross metastatic disease burden at 2 weeks following tumor cell injection. These effects were abrogated by NET inhibition with DNAse or a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) severely threaten human health and the ecological environment because most of them are toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic.

Up to now, numerous VOC treatment technologies have emerged, such as incineration, condensation, biological degradation, absorption, adsorption, and catalysis oxidation et al.

The building industry uses great quantities of raw materials that also involve high energy consumption. Choosing materials with high content in embodied energy entails an initial high level of energy consumption in the building production stage but also determines future energy consumption in order to fulfil heating, ventilation and air conditioning demands. This paper presents the results of an LCA study comparing the most commonly used building materials with some eco-materials using three different impact categories. The aim is to deepen the knowledge of energy and environmental specifications of building materials, analysing their possibilities for improvement and providing guidelines for materials selection in the eco-design of new buildings and rehabilitation of existing buildings.

With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings.

Several recent studies have shown that declining rates of evaporative demand are primarily governed by trends in the aerodynamic component (primarily being the combination of the effects of wind speed (u) and atmospheric humidity) and secondarily by changes in the radiative component. A number of these studies also show that declining rates of observed near-surface u (termed \u2018stilling\u2019) is the primary factor contributing to declining rates of evaporative demand. One objective of this paper was to review and synthesise the literature to assess whether stilling is a globally widespread phenomenon. We analysed 148 studies reporting terrestrial u trends from across the globe (with uneven and incomplete spatial distribution and differing periods of measurement) and found that the average trend was \u22120.014\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121\u00a0a\u22121 for studies with more than 30 sites observing data for more than 30\u00a0years, which confirmed that stilling was widespread. Assuming a linear trend this constitutes a \u22120.7\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 change in u over 50\u00a0years. A second objective was to confirm the declining rates of evaporative demand by reviewing papers reporting trends in measured pan evaporation (Epan) and estimated crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo); average trends were \u22123.19\u00a0mm\u00a0a\u22122 (n\u00a0=\u00a055) and \u22121.31\u00a0mm\u00a0a\u22122 (n\u00a0=\u00a026), respectively. A third objective was to assess the contribution to evaporative demand trends that the four primary meteorological variables (being u; atmospheric humidity; radiation; and air temperature) made. The results from 36 studies highlighted the importance of u trends. We also quantified the sensitivity of rates of evaporative demand to changes in u and how the relative contributions of the aerodynamic and radiative components change seasonally over the globe. Our review: (i) shows that terrestrial stilling is widespread across the globe; (ii) confirms declining rates of evaporative demand; and (iii) highlights the contribution u has made to these declining evaporative rates. Hence we advocate that assessing evaporative demand trends requires consideration of all four primary meteorological variables (being u, atmospheric humidity, radiation and air temperature). This is particularly relevant for long-term water resource assessment because changes in u exert greater influence on energy-limited water-yielding catchments than water-limited ones.",

Exotic species affect the biogeochemical pools and fluxes of materials and energy, thereby altering the fundamental structure and function of their ecosystems. Rapidly accumulating evidence from many species of both animal and plant invaders suggests that invasive species often increase pool sizes, particularly of biomass, and promote accelerated flux rates, but many exceptions can be found. Ecosystem dynamics are altered through a variety of interacting, mutually reinforcing mechanistic pathways, including species' resource acquisition traits; population densities; ability to engineer changes to physical environmental conditions; effects on disturbance, especially fire; regimes; the ability to structure habitat for other species; and their impact on food webs. Local factors of landscape setting, history, and other sources of disturbance constrain ecosystem responses to invasions. New research directions are suggested, including the need for whole-system budgets, the quantification of abundance-impact relationships for particular ecosystem processes, and a better exploration of food web impacts on ecosystem processes.",

Abstract This paper investigates the causal relationship between energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, trade openness and urbanization for a panel of new EU member and candidate countries over the period 1992\u20132010. Panel unit root tests, panel cointegration methods and panel causality tests are used to investigate this relationship. The main results provide evidence supporting the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between environment and income for the sampled countries. The results also indicate that there is a short-run unidirectional panel causality running from energy consumption, trade openness and urbanization to carbon emissions, from GDP to energy consumption, from GDP, energy consumption and urbanization to trade openness, from urbanization to GDP, and from urbanization to trade openness. As for the long-run causal relationship, the results indicate that estimated coefficients of lagged error correction term in the carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, GDP, and trade openness equations are statistically significant, implying that these four variables could play an important role in adjustment process as the system departs from the long-run equilibrium.",

A fast, simplified potential-based approach is presented that estimates the protein\u2212ligand binding affinity based on the given 3D structure of a protein\u2212ligand complex. This general, knowledge-based approach exploits structural information of known protein\u2212ligand complexes extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and converts it into distance-dependent Helmholtz free interaction energies of protein\u2212ligand atom pairs (potentials of mean force, PMF). The definition of an appropriate reference state and the introduction of a correction term accounting for the volume taken by the ligand were found to be crucial for deriving the relevant interaction potentials that treat solvation and entropic contributions implicitly. A significant correlation between experimental binding affinities and computed score was found for sets of diverse protein\u2212ligand complexes and for sets of different ligands bound to the same target. For 77 protein\u2212ligand complexes taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the calculated score showed a standard deviation from observed binding affinities of 1.8 log Ki units and an R2 value of 0.61. The best results were obtained for the subset of 16 serine protease complexes with a standard deviation of 1.0 log Ki unit and an R2 value of 0.86. A set of 33 inhibitors modeled into a crystal structure of HIV-1 protease yielded a standard deviation of 0.8 log Ki units from measured inhibition constants and an R2 value of 0.74. In contrast to empirical scoring functions that show similar or sometimes better correlation with observed binding affinities, our method does not involve deriving specific parameters that fit the observed binding affinities of protein\u2212ligand complexes of a given training set. We compared the performance of the PMF score, B\u00f6hm's score (LUDI), and the SMOG score for eight different test sets of protein\u2212ligand complexes. It was found that for the majority of test sets the PMF score performs best. The strength of the new approach presented here lies in its generality as no knowledge about measured binding affinities is needed to derive atomic interaction potentials. The use of the new scoring function in docking studies is outlined.",

We upscaled FLUXNET observations of carbon dioxide, water, and energy fluxes to the global scale using the machine learning technique, model tree ensembles (MTE). We trained MTE to predict site-level gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent energy (LE), and sensible heat (H) based on remote sensing indices, climate and meteorological data, and information on land use. We applied the trained MTEs to generate global flux fields at a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution and a monthly temporal resolution from 1982 to 2008. Cross-validation analyses revealed good performance of MTE in predicting among-site flux variability with modeling efficiencies (MEf) between 0.64 and 0.84, except for NEE (MEf = 0.32). Performance was also good for predicting seasonal patterns (MEf between 0.84 and 0.89, except for NEE (0.64)). By comparison, predictions of monthly anomalies were not as strong (MEf between 0.29 and 0.52). Improved accounting of disturbance and lagged environmental effects, along with improved characterization of errors in the training data set, would contribute most to further reducing uncertainties. Our global estimates of LE (158 +\/- 7 J x 10(18) yr(-1)), H (164 +\/- 15 J x 10(18) yr(-1)), and GPP (119 +\/- 6 Pg C yr(-1)) were similar to independent estimates. Our global TER estimate (96 +\/- 6 Pg C yr(-1)) was likely underestimated by 5-10%. Hot spot regions of interannual variability in carbon fluxes occurred in semiarid to semihumid regions and were controlled by moisture supply. Overall, GPP was more important to interannual variability in NEE than TER. Our empirically derived fluxes may be used for calibration and evaluation of land surface process models and for exploratory and diagnostic assessments of the biosphere.",

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are major players in the progression and drug resistance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CAFs constitute a diverse cell population consisting of several recently described subtypes, although the extent of CAF heterogeneity has remained undefined. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to thoroughly characterize the neoplastic and tumor microenvironment content of human and mouse PDAC tumors. We corroborate the presence of myofibroblastic CAFs and inflammatory CAFs and define their unique gene signatures in vivo. Moreover, we describe a new population of CAFs that express MHC class II and CD74, but do not express classic costimulatory molecules. We term this cell population \"antigen-presenting CAFs\" and find that they activate CD4+ T cells in an antigen-specific fashion in a model system, confirming their putative immune-modulatory capacity. Our cross-species analysis paves the way for investigating distinct functions of CAF subtypes in PDAC immunity and progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Appreciating the full spectrum of fibroblast heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is crucial to developing therapies that specifically target tumor-promoting CAFs. This work identifies MHC class II-expressing CAFs with a capacity to present antigens to CD4+ T cells, and potentially to modulate the immune response in pancreatic tumors.See related commentary by Belle and DeNardo, p. 1001.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 983.",

Some twenty years ago, Harvard Business School economist and strategy professor Michael Porter challenged conventional wisdom about the impact of environmental regulation on business by declaring that well-designed regulation could actually enhance competitiveness. The traditional view of environmental regulation held by virtually all economists until that time was that requiring firms to reduce an externality like pollution necessarily restricted their options and thus by definition reduced their profits. After all, if profitable opportunities existed to reduce pollution, profit-maximizing firms would already be taking advantage of them. Over the past twenty years, much has been written about what has since become known simply as the Porter Hypothesis. Yet even today, we continue to find conflicting evidence concerning the Porter Hypothesis, alternative theories that might explain it, and oftentimes a misunderstanding of what the Porter Hypothesis does and does not say. This article examines the key theoretical foundations and empirical evidence concerning the Porter Hypothesis, discusses its implications for the design of environmental regulations, and outlines directions for future research on the relationship between environmental regulation, innovation, and competitiveness.",

Time series of ocean properties provide a measure of global ice volume and monitor key features of the wind-driven and density-driven circulations over the past 400,000 years. Cycles with periods near 23,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years dominate this climatic narrative. When the narrative is examined in a geographic array of time series, the phase of each climatic oscillation is seen to progress through the system in essentially the same geographic sequence in all three cycles. We argue that the 23,000- and 41,000-year cycles of glaciation are continuous, linear responses to orbitally driven changes in the Arctic radiation budget; and we use the phase progression in each climatic cycle to identify the main pathways along which the initial, local responses to radiation are propagated by the atmosphere and ocean. Early in this progression, deep waters of the Southern Ocean appear to act as a carbon trap. To stimulate new observations and modeling efforts, we offer a process model that gives a synoptic view of climate at the four end-member states needed to describe the system's evolution, and we propose a dynamic system model that explains the phase progression along causal pathways by specifying inertial constants in a chain of four subsystems.\r\n\r\n\u201cSolutions to problems involving systems of such complexity are not born full grown like Athena from the head of Zeus.

There are reports that nano-sized zero-valent iron (Fe0) exhibits greater reactivity than micro-sized particles of Fe0, and it has been suggested that the higher reactivity of nano-Fe0 may impart advantages for groundwater remediation or other environmental applications. However, most of these reports are preliminary in that they leave a hostof potentiallysignificant(and often challenging) material or process variables either uncontrolled or unresolved. In an effort to better understand the reactivity of nano-Fe0, we have used a variety of complementary techniques to characterize two widely studied nano-Fe0 preparations: one synthesized by reduction of goethite with heat and H2 (Fe(H2)) and the other by reductive precipitation with borohydride (Fe(BH)). Fe(H2) is a two-phase material consisting of 40 nm alpha-Fe0 (made up of crystals approximately the size of the particles) and Fe3O4 particles of similar size or larger containing reduced sulfur; whereas Fe(BH) is mostly 20-80 nm metallic Fe particles (aggregates of <1.5 nm grains) with an oxide shell\/coating that is high in oxidized boron. The FeBH particles further aggregate into chains. Both materials exhibit corrosion potentials that are more negative than nano-sized Fe2O3, Fe3O4, micro-sized Fe0, or a solid Fe0 disk, which is consistent with their rapid reduction of oxygen, benzoquinone, and carbon tetrachloride. Benzoquinone-which presumably probes inner-sphere surface reactions-reacts more rapidly with FeBH than Fe(H2), whereas carbon tetrachloride reacts at similar rates with FeBH and Fe(H2), presumably by outer-sphere electron transfer. Both types of nano-Fe0 react more rapidlythan micro-sized Fe0 based on mass-normalized rate constants, but surface area-normalized rate constants do not show a significant nano-size effect. The distribution of products from reduction of carbon tetrachloride is more favorable with Fe(H2), which produces less chloroform than reaction with Fe(BH).",

In this study we compile and present results from the factor analysis of 43 Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) datasets (27 of the datasets are reanalyzed in this work). The components from all sites, when taken together, provide a holistic overview of Northern Hemisphere organic aerosol (OA) and its evolution in the atmosphere. At most sites, the OA can be separated into oxygenated OA (OOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), and sometimes other components such as biomass burning OA (BBOA). We focus on the OOA components in this work. In many analyses, the OOA can be further deconvolved into low-volatility OOA (LV-OOA) and semi-volatile OOA (SV-OOA). Differences in the mass spectra of these components are characterized in terms of the two main ions m\/z 44 (CO2+) and m\/z 43 (mostly C2H3O+), which are used to develop a new mass spectral diagnostic for following the aging of OA components in the atmosphere. The LV-OOA component spectra have higher f44 (ratio of m\/z 44 to total signal in the component mass spectrum) and lower f43 (ratio of m\/z 43 to total signal in the component mass spectrum) than SV-OOA. A wide range of f44 and O:C ratios are observed for both LV-OOA (0.17\u00b10.04, 0.73\u00b10.14) and SV-OOA (0.07\u00b10.04, 0.35\u00b10.14) components, reflecting the fact that there is a continuum of OOA properties in ambient aerosol. The OOA components (OOA, LV-OOA, and SV-OOA) from all sites cluster within a well-defined triangular region in the f44 vs. f43 space, which can be used as a standardized means for comparing and characterizing any OOA components (laboratory or ambient) observed with the AMS. Examination of the OOA components in this triangular space indicates that OOA component spectra become increasingly similar to each other and to fulvic acid and HULIS sample spectra as f44 (a surrogate for O:C and an indicator of photochemical aging) increases. This indicates that ambient OA converges towards highly aged LV-OOA with atmospheric oxidation. The common features of the transformation between SV-OOA and LV-OOA at multiple sites potentially enable a simplified description of the oxidation of OA in the atmosphere. Comparison of laboratory SOA data with ambient OOA indicates that laboratory SOA are more similar to SV-OOA and rarely become as oxidized as ambient LV-OOA, likely due to the higher loadings employed in the experiments and\/or limited oxidant exposure in most chamber experiments.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease posits that the excessive accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide leads to neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau. However, to date, no single disease model has serially linked these two pathological events using human neuronal cells. Mouse models with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations exhibit amyloid-\u03b2-induced synaptic and memory deficits but they do not fully recapitulate other key pathological events of Alzheimer's disease, including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Human neurons derived from Alzheimer's disease patients have shown elevated levels of toxic amyloid-\u03b2 species and phosphorylated tau but did not demonstrate amyloid-\u03b2 plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Here we report that FAD mutations in \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 are able to induce robust extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2, including amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, in a human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system. More importantly, the 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing FAD mutations exhibited high levels of detergent-resistant, silver-positive aggregates of phosphorylated tau in the soma and neurites, as well as filamentous tau, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Inhibition of amyloid-\u03b2 generation with \u03b2- or \u03b3-secretase inhibitors not only decreased amyloid-\u03b2 pathology, but also attenuated tauopathy. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) regulated amyloid-\u03b2-mediated tau phosphorylation. We have successfully recapitulated amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology in a single 3D human neural cell culture system. Our unique strategy for recapitulating Alzheimer's disease pathology in a 3D neural cell culture model should also serve to facilitate the development of more precise human neural cell models of other neurodegenerative disorders.",

The comparison, sponsored by IGBP-GAIM\/DIS\/GCTE, used standardized input variables wherever possible and was carried out through two international workshops and over the Internet. The models differed widely in complexity and original purpose, but could be grouped in three major categories: satellite-based models that use data from the NOAA\/AVHRR sensor as their major input stream (CASA, GLO-PEM, SDBM, SIB2 and TURC), models that simulate carbon fluxes using a prescribed vegetation structure (BIOME-BGC, CARAIB 2.1, CENTURY 4.0, FBM 2.2, HRBM 3.0, KGBM, PLAI 0.2, SILVAN 2.2 and TEM 4.0), and models that simulate both vegetation structure and carbon fluxes (BIOME3, DOLY and HYBRID 3.0). The simulations resulted in a range of total NPP values (44.4\u201366.3 Pg C year\u20131), after removal of two outliers (which produced extreme results as artefacts due to the comparison). The broad global pattern of NPP and the relationship of annual NPP to the major climatic variables coincided in most areas. Differences could not be attributed to the fundamental modelling strategies, with the exception that nutrient constraints generally produced lower NPP. Regional and global NPP were sensitive to the simulation method for the water balance. Seasonal variation among models was high, both globally and locally, providing several indications for specific deficiencies in some models.",

Despite the relationship between urbanization, energy use and CO2 emissions has been extensively studied in recent years, little attention has been paid to differences in development stages or income levels. Most previous studies have implicitly assumed that the impact of urbanization is homogenous for all countries. This assumption can be questionable as there are many characteristic differences among countries of different levels of affluence. This paper investigates empirically the effects of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of the different development stages. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975\u20132005, the findings suggest that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the stages of development. Surprisingly, urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups. The impact of urbanization on emissions is positive for all the income groups, but it is more pronounced in the middle-income group than in the other income groups. These novel findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also can be of special interest to policy makers and urban planners.",

Results suggest that meaningful EKCs exist only for local air pollutants whilst indicators with a more global, or indirect, impact either increase monotonically with income or else have predicted turning points at high per capita income levels with large standard errors \u2013 unless they have been subjected to a multilateral policy initiative. Two other findings are also made: that concentration of local pollutants in urban areas peak at a lower per capita income level than total emissions per capita; and that transport-generated local air pollutants peak at a higher per capita income level than total emissions per capita. Given these findings, suggestions are made regarding the necessary future direction of environmental policy.",

    "text":"Effect of Surface Composition on Electronic Structure, Stability, and Electrocatalytic Properties of Pt-Transition Metal Alloys: Pt-Skin versus Pt-Skeleton Surfaces. The surface properties of PtM (M = Co, Ni, Fe) polycrystalline alloys are studied by utilizing Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy ion scattering spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. For each alloy initial surface characterization was done in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system, and depending on preparation procedure it was possible to form surfaces with two different compositions. Due to surface segregation thermodynamics, annealed alloy surfaces form the outermost Pt-skin surface layer, which consists only platinum atoms, while the sputtered surfaces have the bulk ratio of alloying components. The measured valence band density of state spectra clearly shows the differences in electronic structures between Pt-skin and sputtered surfaces. Well-defined surfaces were hereafter transferred out from UHV and exposed to the acidic (electro)chemical environment. The electrochemical and post-electrochemical UHV surface characterizations revealed that Pt-skin surfaces are stable during and after immersion to an electrolyte. In contrast all sputtered surfaces formed Pt-skeleton outermost layers due to dissolution of transition metal atoms. Therefore, these three different near-surface compositions (Pt-skin, Pt-skeleton, and pure polycrystalline Pt) all having pure-Pt outermost layers are found to have different electronic structures, which originates from different arrangements of subsurface atoms of the alloying component. Modification in Pt electronic properties alters adsorption\/catalytic properties of the corresponding bimetallic alloy. The most active systems for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction are established to be the Pt-skin near-surface composition, which also have the most shifted metallic d-band center position versus Fermi level.",

    "text":"Advanced compression-ignition engines\u2014understanding the in-cylinder processes. Advanced compression-ignition (CI) engines can deliver both high efficiencies and very low NOX and particulate (PM) emissions. Efficiencies are comparable to conventional diesel engines, but unlike conventional diesel engines, the charge is highly dilute and premixed (or partially premixed) to achieve low emissions. Dilution is accomplished by operating either lean or with large amounts of EGR. The development of these advanced CI engines has evolved mainly along two lines. First, for fuels other than diesel, a combustion process commonly known as homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) is generally used, in which the charge is premixed before being compression ignited. Although termed \u201chomogeneous,\u201d there are always some thermal or mixture inhomogeneities in real HCCI engines, and it is sometimes desirable to introduce additional stratification. Second, for diesel fuel (which autoignites easily but has low volatility) an alternative low-temperature combustion (LTC) approach is used, in which the autoignition is closely coupled to the fuel-injection event to provide control over ignition timing. To obtain dilute LTC, this approach relies on high levels of EGR, and injection timing is typically shifted 10\u201315\u00b0 CA earlier or later than for conventional diesel combustion so temperatures are lower, which delays ignition and provides more time for premixing. Although these advanced CI combustion modes have important advantages, there are difficulties to implementing them in practical engines. In this article, the principles of HCCI and diesel LTC engines are reviewed along with the results of research on the in-cylinder processes. This research has resulted in substantial progress toward overcoming the main challenges facing these engines, including: improving low-load combustion efficiency, increasing the high-load limit, understanding fuel effects, and maintaining low NOX and PM emissions over the operating range.",

Low-pressure single-component CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured every 10 \u00b0C from 20 to 200 \u00b0C, allowing the performance of each material to be analyzed precisely. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the separation phenomena and the thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption, the isotherms were analyzed using a variety of methods. With regard to the isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, Mg2(dobdc) exhibits an abrupt drop at loadings approaching the saturation of the Mg2+ sites, which has significant implications for regeneration in different industrial applications. The CO2\/N2 selectivities were calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) for MOF-177, Mg2(dobdc), and zeolite NaX, and working capacities were estimated using a simplified TSA model. Significantly, MOF-177 fails to exhibit a positive working capacity even at regeneration temperatures as high as 200 \u00b0C, while Mg2(dobdc) reaches a working capacity of 17.6 wt % at this temperature. Breakthrough simulations were also performed for the three materials, demonstrating the superior performance of Mg2(dobdc) over MOF-177 and zeolite NaX. These results show that the presence of strong CO2 adsorption sites is essential for a metal\u2013organic framework to be of utility in post-combustion CO2 capture via a TSA process, and present a methodology for the evaluation of new metal\u2013organic frameworks via analysis of single-component gas adsorption isotherms.",

Anaerobic\u2013aerobic systems have been remarkably employed in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment for many years. While previously most treatment of wastewaters have been carried out in conventional anaerobic\u2013aerobic treatment plants, in recent years, high rate anaerobic\u2013aerobic bioreactors have been increasingly employed for wastewaters with high chemical oxygen demand (COD). This paper provides a review of the various types of high rate anaerobic\u2013aerobic water treatment techniques currently available including high rate bioreactors and integrated anaerobic\u2013aerobic bioreactors. The integrated bioreactors are classified into four types, which are (i) integrated bioreactors with physical separation of anaerobic\u2013aerobic zone, (ii) integrated bioreactors without physical separation of anaerobic\u2013aerobic zone, (iii) anaerobic\u2013aerobic Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR), and (iv) combined anaerobic\u2013aerobic culture system. The integration of aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways in a single bioreactor is capable of enhancing the overall degradation efficiency. The merits of different integrated anaerobic\u2013aerobic bioreactors are highlighted and comparison made to identify possible future areas of research to fully utilize these methods of wastewater treatment. The comparison demonstrates that using an integrated bioreactor with stacked configuration in treating high strength industrial wastewaters is advantageous due to minimal space requirements, low capital cost and excellent COD removal efficiencies (in excess of 83%).",

Clear understanding of the links between ecological functions and biodiversity is needed to assess and predict the true environmental consequences of human activities. Several key ecosystem functions are provided by coprophagous beetles in the subfamily Scarabaeinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), which feed on animal excreta as both adults and larvae. Through manipulating feces during the feeding process, dung beetles instigate a series of ecosystem functions ranging from secondary seed dispersal to nutrient cycling and parasite suppression. Many of these ecological functions provide valuable ecosystem services such as biological pest control and soil fertilization. Here we summarize the contributions of dung beetles to nutrient cycling, bioturbation, plant growth enhancement, secondary seed dispersal and parasite control, as well as highlight their more limited role in pollination and trophic regulation. We discuss where these ecosystem functions clearly translate into ecosystem services, outline areas in critical need of additional research and describe a research agenda to fill those gaps. Due to the high sensitivity of dung beetles to habitat modification and changing dung resources, many of these ecological processes have already been disrupted or may be affected in the future. Prediction of the functional consequences of dung beetle decline demands functional studies conducted with naturally assembled beetle communities, which broaden the geographic scope of existing work, assess the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple functions, and link these ecosystem processes more clearly to ecosystem services.",

Energy from biomass, bioenergy, is a perspective source to replace fossil fuels in the future, as it is abundant, clean, and carbon dioxide neutral. Biomass can be combusted directly to generate heat and electricity, and by means of thermo-chemical and bio-chemical processes it can be converted into bio-fuels in the forms of solid (e.g., charcoal), liquid (e.g., bio-oils, methanol and ethanol), and gas (e.g., methane and hydrogen), which can be used further for heat and power generation. This paper provides an overview of the principles, reactions, and applications of four fundamental thermo-chemical processes (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) for bioenergy production, as well as recent developments in these technologies. Some advanced thermo-chemical processes, including co-firing\/co-combustion of biomass with coal or natural gas, fast pyrolysis, plasma gasification and supercritical water gasification, are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages, potential for future applications and challenges of these processes are discussed. The co-firing of biomass and coal is the easiest and most economical approach for the generation of bioenergy on a large-sale. Fast pyrolysis has attracted attention as it is to date the only industrially available technology for the production of bio-oils. Plasma techniques, due to their high destruction and reduction efficiencies for any form of waste, have great application potential for hazardous waste treatment.

Most metabolic reactions in cells take place in reducing compartments such as the mitochondria or cytoplasm. This is presumably because critical thiol groups and other key catalytic elements of enzyme active sites must be protected against oxidation. Protein disulfide bonds are rarely found in such environments. On the other hand, normal cell function requires that some compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes, be oxidizing. This is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins destined for export, which frequently contain disulfide bridges.Much has recently been learned regarding the mechanisms responsible for homeostasis of redox status in certain subcellular compartments. In yeast, the formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum utilizes conserved Ero1p (2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

In addition, the disulfide exchange component protein-disulfide isomerase ensures formation of the correct disulfides (6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (for reviews, see Refs. 7Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol.

In prokaryotes, a thioredoxin-like family of enzymes catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in proteins via highly specific disulfide exchange reactions (9Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 99: 117-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In all cells, small molecules capable of thiol-disulfide exchange like GSH are abundant and were previously thought to act as redox buffers, but this hypothesis has been disproved. For example, in the protein export pathway, GSH actually competes with protein thiols for oxidizing equivalents (8Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat.

Thus, the primary role of small thiols may be one of defense against oxidants and other deleterious compounds (for reviews, see Refs. 2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

For example, oxidative events have been implicated in activating the mitochondrial permeability transition, leading to cytochrome c release and cell death (13Shi Y. Nat. Struct.

Cell Biochem. 2002; 234: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are now recognized to be second messengers that can directly modulate the activity of target proteins as well as indirectly couple cellular responses to external events. These processes can result in the nitrosylation or oxidation of specific cysteine residues on a target protein to one of several possible states, directly modulating the activity of target. Signal transduction mechanisms involving such oxidative modifications are now recognized to rival protein phosphorylation in significance.Given the importance of and general interest in cellular redox processes, a noninvasive method for reporting redox changes within living cells is highly desirable. Until now, no general approach for nondestructive readout of redox status has been available. Whereas several methods of determining in vivo redox status have been proposed, all have serious limitations. Most techniques require cells to be harvested before their contents can be analyzed. For example, several attempts have been made to directly measure the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, which is with few exceptions the most abundant nonprotein thiol in eukaryotic cells (20Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This ratio has been found to range from 1:1 to 3:1 in the secretory pathway, and in total cellular material it has been found to range from 100:1 to 300:1. Whereas these results point to dramatic differences in redox poise within compartments, with such an approach it is of course impossible to monitor redox changes within the same cell over a period of time. Keese et al. (21Keese M.A. Saffrich R. Dandekar T. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) proposed an alternative procedure in which crystals of the enzyme glutathione reductase are microinjected into the cytosol of human fibroblasts. By detection of color changes in the crystals, they were able to determine the redox potential of the cytosol to be more reducing than -0.270 V. Whereas this method may allow redox status determination within single living cells, it is cumbersome.Indicators that give visual response to changes in dynamic redox status can be constructed from the green fluorescent protein (GFP), 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; roGFP, redox-sensitive GFP; DTT, dithiothreitol; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; roGFP, redox-sensitive GFP; DTT, dithiothreitol; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. which has become a popular tool for molecular labeling in vivo (for reviews, see Refs. 22Tsien R.Y.

GFP is most often used as a passive indicator of gene expression and protein localization, but variants have been constructed that act as indicators of intracellular concentrations of H+, Ca2+, and halide ions (25Kneen M.

The key properties of GFP are efficient fluorescence, protease resistance, and stability throughout a wide range of pH and solvent conditions. Moreover, GFP can be targeted to specific organelles within the host cell, permitting conditions at localized areas to be monitored in a single cell over a period of time.An indicator for redox status can be constructed from GFP by introduction of redox-reactive groups into the protein, at locations where a change in the oxidation state of the introduced group(s) would modify the fluorescent properties. Ostergaard et al. (33Ostergaard H. Henriksen A. Hansen F.G. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) introduced pairs of cysteines onto the surface of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (34Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) in appropriate locations to form disulfide bridges in an oxidizing environment. The indicators, designated rxYFPNM (where N and M indicate the locations of introduced cysteines) were successfully expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and were shown to respond, by changes in fluorescence intensity, to membrane-permeable redox agents 4,4\u2032-dithiodipyridine and dithiothreitol (DTT). The indicators also responded to mutational disruption of the trxB gene, which codes for the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase and is partially responsible for the reducing state of the cytoplasm. Although the results of these efforts are promising, rxYFPNM redox probes suffer from several limitations. Because only the intensity of fluorescence is affected by disulfide bond formation, the probes are not ratiometric and would be difficult to calibrate (32Hanson G.T. McAnaney T.B. Park E.S. Rendell M. Yarbrough D.K. Chu S. Xi L. Boxer S.G. Montrose M.H. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15477-15488Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 35Grynkiewicz G. Martin P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A further complication arises from the fact that YFP fluorescence is quenched by a low concentration of halides and other small anions (36Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R628-R629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D. Kallio K. Remington S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Here, we describe the independent development and preliminary application of several GFP-based indicators of redox status. The indicators are ratiometric by excitation, which reduces or eliminates measurement errors resulting from changes of indicator concentration, photobleaching, and variable cell thickness. Directed substitution of cysteine residues at selected surface sites in the vicinity of the GFP chromophore but upon different GFP backgrounds resulted in indicators with apparent midpoint potentials in the range -0.27 to -0.29 V. We term these probes redox-sensitive GFPs (roGFPs).Analysis of the oxidized and reduced crystal structures of roGFP2 verified reversible formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge and revealed an oxidation-dependent strain in the polypeptide backbone that may account for the observed spectral changes. Using cultured mammalian cells expressing roGFP1 in the mitochondria, we show that the probe reversibly reports redox changes in response to application of membrane-permeable oxidizing and reducing agents. Measurements were conducted on single cells using a fluorescence microscope and with cell suspensions in an ordinary fluorometer with comparable results. After correcting for the estimated pH (\u223c8.0) of the mitochondria, the in vivo results suggest that the redox potential of resting mitochondria in HeLa cells is near -360 mV.MATERIALS AND METHODSStructure-based Design of Redox-sensitive GFP Variants\u2014roGFP indicators were designed with the concept that cross-links between pairs of surface-exposed cysteine residues may induce structural strain in the protein. For locations close to the chromophore, modifications of the chromophore environment can be expected to result in changes in the fluorescence excitation or emission properties. To prevent undesirable cross-link formation, we attempted to replace the two cysteines present in wild-type GFP at positions 48 and 70 (38Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 229-233Crossref Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) by serine and alanine, respectively. The substitution of Cys70 proved to be deleterious to obtaining soluble, fluorescent protein, so the C48S construct was used as the background in most cases. Candidate sites for introduction of potential disulfide pairs were selected by visual inspection of the atomic model for S65T GFP (34Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1EMA) for surface locations with approximately the required separation and orientation for formation of a disulfide linkage (39Sowdhamini R.

Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The two sets of sites reported in this work included Ser147 and Gln204 (roGFP1 and -2; see Table I) and Asn149 and Ser202 (roGFP3 and -4), each flanking His148. The single-cysteine variants were created on either pseudo-wild type background (C48S\/Q80R) or (C48S\/Q80R\/S65T), and their properties were investigated before construction of the double cysteine substitutions. Finally, the double disulfide variant was constructed (roGFP5 and -6) with and without the S65T mutation.Table ISpectroscopic excitation ratios and redox equilibrium properties of roGFPsVariantaVariants in this column also contain the two phenotypically neutral substitutions C48S and Q80R.IDKeqbEquilibrium constant (Keq) values are given for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox roGFPox + DTTred (see exception below for lipoic acid in Footnote f).E0'cE0' values are for pH 7 and 30\u00b0C.\u03b4dThe dynamic range value (\u03b4) is the maximum observed \u03b4-fold change in excitation peak ratio.VS147C\/Q204CroGFP10.070\u22120.2886.1eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C\/Q204CfValues estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, \u2212290 mV), average of two experiments.roGFP10.83fValues estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, \u2212290 mV), average of two experiments.\u22120.2874.5eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C\/Q204C\/S65TroGFP20.021\u22120.2725.8gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.N149C\/S202CroGFP30.151\u22120.2994.3eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.N149C\/S202C\/S65TroGFP40.056\u22120.2862.6gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.S147C\/Q204C\/N149C\/S202CroGFP50.134\u22120.2967.8eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C\/Q204C\/N149C\/S202C\/S65TroGFP60.039\u22120.2805.4gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.a Variants in this column also contain the two phenotypically neutral substitutions C48S and Q80R.b Equilibrium constant (Keq) values are given for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox roGFPox + DTTred (see exception below for lipoic acid in Footnote f).c E0' values are for pH 7 and 30\u00b0C.d The dynamic range value (\u03b4) is the maximum observed \u03b4-fold change in excitation peak ratio.e Measured at 475 and 400 nm.f Values estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, \u2212290 mV), average of two experiments.g Measured at 490 and 400 nm. Open table in a new tab Gene Construction and Protein Expression\u2014Mutations were introduced via the QuikChange\u2122 kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing of the entire GFP coding sequence verified all mutations. Mutations were initially introduced into a His-tagged version of wild-type (Q80R) GFP in the plasmid pRSETB. For expression in mammalian cells, the mutations C48S\/T65S\/S147C\/Q204C (which contains S65T) and C48S\/S147C\/Q204C (roGFP1 and -2) were introduced into the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) containing in addition the leader sequence of the E1\u03b1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase for mitochondrial targeting (a gift of R. M. Brown and G. K. Brown, University of Oxford). The resulting plasmid also contained the so-called \u201cfolding mutation\u201d F64L, which seems to improve the efficiency of proper folding and chromophore formation in vivo (41Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). To verify that F64L did not significantly alter the properties of roGFPs, the mutation was introduced into the original pRSETB plasmid. In side-by-side experiments, roGFP2 and roGFP2\/F64L had indistinguishable spectral and redox properties (data not shown).Mutant protein was expressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3) by use of the pRSETB expression system with an N-terminal His6 tag. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and sonicated for 7 min. Cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The N-terminal histidine tag was removed by incubation with 1:50 (w\/w) \u03b3-chymotrypsin for 20 h at 22 \u00b0C. Samples were concentrated by filtration (Centricon 10; Amicon) and buffer-exchanged with PD-10 Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences) into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9.Spectroscopy and Redox Titrations\u2014Fluorescence excitation spectra were collected on Hitachi F4500 and PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometers at 30 \u00b0C. Samples consisted of 1 \u03bcm GFP in 75 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm total DTT (mixture of oxidized and reduced forms). To reduce air oxidation, the solutions were degassed and subsequently flushed with nitrogen. Where possible, most solutions were prepared and allowed to equilibrate in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere.In general, equilibrium was obtained within 1 h at pH 7.0. However, the samples were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 4 h to ensure equilibration of the GFP-DTT system. Because the equilibrium constant for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox \u2194 roGFPox + DTTred is much less than 1 (see \u201cResults\u201d), the results were checked by performing an alternative titration against reduced and oxidized lipoic acid (10 mm in the above buffer) for roGFP1, as described elsewhere. 2C. T. Dooley, T. M. Dore, G. Hanson, W. C. Jackson, S. J. Remington, and R. Y. Tsien, submitted for publication. The equilibrated reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, which showed no evidence for species corresponding to disulfide-linked dimers (data not shown). Therefore, any disulfides that are formed are intramolecular (see below for crystallographic evidence).Determination of Midpoint Potentials\u2014Apparent redox midpoint potential values for roGFPs were found by exploiting the fact that the fluorescence excitation spectrum of roGFPs is strongly and reversibly dependent upon the redox state of the introduced cysteines. When equilibrated against redox buffers consisting of reduced and oxidized dithiothreitol (DTTred, DTTox) or lipoic acid, fluorescence spectra of roGFPs revealed amplitude changes in the two excitation maxima with a well defined isosbestic point. The redox reaction of the roGFPs with reduced and oxidized DTT could thus be analyzed using a two-state model. The equilibrium for the oxidation of reduced roGFP by DTTox and the corresponding equilibrium constant (Keq) are given by Reaction 1 and Equation 1. roGFPred+DTTox\u2194roGFPox+DTTredReaction 1 Keq=[roGFPox][DTTred]\/[roGFPred][DTTox](Eq. 1) When roGFPs were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of DTTred and DTTox (total DTTred + DTTox = 1 mm), the fractional amount of reduced roGFP at equilibrium (R) could be measured over the whole range from the oxidized to the reduced protein using the chromophore fluorescence. Since SDS-PAGE and crystallography revealed that roGFPs form only intramolecular disulfide bonds, R can be related to Keq by Equation 2 (42Hawkins H.C. De Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). R=([DTTred]\/[DTTox])\/(Keq+[DTTred]\/[DTTox])(Eq. 2) For experimental determination of the equilibrium constants of the roGFP-dithiothreitol system, the equilibrium concentrations of DTTred and DTTox were calculated according to Equations 3-5. In these expressions, [DTTred o] and [DTTox o] are the initial concentrations of DTTred and DTTox, respectively, R is the fractional amount of reduced roGFP at equilibrium, [roGFPo] is the initial concentration of oxidized roGFP, F is a fluorescence intensity ratio of excitation at 490 nm versus the isosbestic point (425 nm), and Fox and Fred are the 490\/425 nm ratios of the completely oxidized and reduced protein, respectively, although any two wavelengths can be chosen. [DTTred]=[DTTred0]-R[roGFP0](Eq. 3) [DTTox]=[DTTox0]-R[roGFP0](Eq. 4) R=(F-Fox)\/(Fred-Fox)(Eq. 5) By plotting R against the [DTTred]\/[DTTox] ratio and fitting the data to a titration curve according to Equation 2, the Keq for the roGFP\/dithiothreitol system could be found. The redox potential of roGFPs at pH 7 and 30 \u00b0C ( E0(roGFP)') could then be calculated from the Nernst equation (6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), where E0' is the biochemist's standard potential of the DTTred\/DTTox couple ( E0(DTT)'=-0.323 V, at pH 7 and 30 \u00b0C (43Sajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2015Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar)), R is the gas constant (8.315 J K-1 mol-1), T is the absolute temperature (303.15 K), n is the number of transferred electrons (2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and F is the Faraday constant (9.649 \u00d7 104 C mol-1). E0(roGFP)'=E0(DTT)'=(RT\/nF)\u00d7lnKeq(Eq. 6) Plots and curve fits were made with KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software). For the case of titration against reduced\/oxidized lipoate, E0(Lip)'=-0.290 V (44Lees W.J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 58: 642-647Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was assumed.Redox potentials involving the liberation of H+ depend intrinsically on pH. The pH dependence of the midpoint potential can be seen from the half-reaction of roGFP reduction as follows. roGFPox+2H++2e-\u2194roGFPredReaction 2 In equilibrium at the midpoint, [roGFPox] = [roGFPred] and Keq = [H+]2. Theoretically, the redox potential of roGFP at 30 \u00b0C can thus be calculated from the Nernst equation and E0' at any pH using Equation 7. E0'pH=E0'-60.1mV\u00d7(pH-7)(Eq. 7) Ratiometric Measurements\u2014The roGFP probes display two fluorescence excitation maxima whose relative amplitudes depend on the specific mutations but also depend on the state of oxidation. This can be used to make ratiometric measurements (35Grynkiewicz G. Martin P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Tsien R.Y. Poenie M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which reduce or eliminate dependence on protein concentration, sample path length, photobleaching, and variable source intensity. The in vitro ratios of the excitation maxima were determined in the fluorometer directly from the excitation spectrum at typically 400 and 475 nm (2.5-nm slit width) for roGFP1 or 400 and 490 nm for roGFP2. The dynamic range parameter \u03b4 is defined as the ratio of the maximum to minimum values of the excitation ratios, and is useful as a measure of the maximum attainable signal\/noise ratio.Crystal Structure Determination\u2014roGFP2\/F64L (C48S\/F64L\/S65T\/Q80R\/S147C\/Q204C) was concentrated to \u223c20 mg ml-1 in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) and 0.2-\u03bcm-filtered. Flat plate-like crystals grew at room temperature in 1-2 days by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 0.07-0.1 m LiSO4, 17-22% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.5 \u03bcm CuCl2 (which catalyzes disulfide formation) or 5 mm DTT for the oxidized and reduced crystals, respectively. Drops contained 4 \u03bcl of protein solution and 4 \u03bcl of well solution. For low temperature diffraction data collection, crystals were exchanged into a solution of 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 0.07-0.1 m LiSO4, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 20% ethylene glycol, and either 0.5 \u03bcm CuCl2 or 5 mm DTT.X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single frozen crystal for each redox state at beamline 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Data sets were indexed and reduced with MOSFLM (46Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing. 5.

    "text":"The Cation\u2212\u03c0 Interaction. The chemistry community now recognizes the cation-\u03c0 interaction as a major force for molecular recognition, joining the hydrophobic effect, the hydrogen bond, and the ion pair in determining macromolecular structure and drug-receptor interactions. This Account provides the author's perspective on the intellectual origins and fundamental nature of the cation-\u03c0 interaction. Early studies on cyclophanes established that water-soluble, cationic molecules would forego aqueous solvation to enter a hydrophobic cavity if that cavity was lined with \u03c0 systems. Important gas phase studies established the fundamental nature of the cation-\u03c0 interaction. The strength of the cation-\u03c0 interaction (Li(+) binds to benzene with 38 kcal\/mol of binding energy; NH4(+) with 19 kcal\/mol) distinguishes it from the weaker polar-\u03c0 interactions observed in the benzene dimer or water-benzene complexes. In addition to the substantial intrinsic strength of the cation-\u03c0 interaction in gas phase studies, the cation-\u03c0 interaction remains energetically significant in aqueous media and under biological conditions. Many studies have shown that cation-\u03c0 interactions can enhance binding energies by 2-5 kcal\/mol, making them competitive with hydrogen bonds and ion pairs in drug-receptor and protein-protein interactions. As with other noncovalent interactions involving aromatic systems, the cation-\u03c0 interaction includes a substantial electrostatic component. The six (four) C(\u03b4-)-H(\u03b4+) bond dipoles of a molecule like benzene (ethylene) combine to produce a region of negative electrostatic potential on the face of the \u03c0 system. Simple electrostatics facilitate a natural attraction of cations to the surface. The trend for (gas phase) binding energies is Li(+) > Na(+) > K(+) > Rb(+): as the ion gets larger the charge is dispersed over a larger sphere and binding interactions weaken, a classical electrostatic effect. On other hand, polarizability does not define these interactions. Cyclohexane is more polarizable than benzene but a decidedly poorer cation binder. Many studies have documented cation-\u03c0 interactions in protein structures, where lysine or arginine side chains interact with phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. In addition, countless studies have established the importance of the cation-\u03c0 interaction in a range of biological processes. Our work has focused on molecular neurobiology, and we have shown that neurotransmitters generally use a cation-\u03c0 interaction to bind to their receptors. We have also shown that many drug-receptor interactions involve cation-\u03c0 interactions. A cation-\u03c0 interaction plays a critical role in the binding of nicotine to ACh receptors in the brain, an especially significant case. Other researchers have established important cation-\u03c0 interactions in the recognition of the \"histone code,\" in terpene biosynthesis, in chemical catalysis, and in many other systems.",

    "text":"A Hydrophobic Stretch of 12 Amino Acid Residues in the Middle of \u03b1-Synuclein Is Essential for Filament Assembly. Neuronal and oligodendrocytic aggregates of fibrillar \u03b1-synuclein define several diseases of the nervous system. It is likely that these inclusions impair vital metabolic processes and compromise vialibity of affected cells. Here, we report that a 12-amino acid stretch (71VTGVTAVAQKTV82) in the middle of the hydrophobic domain of human \u03b1-synuclein is necessary and sufficient for its fibrillization based on the following observations: 1) human \u03b2-synuclein is highly homologous to \u03b1-synuclein but lacks these 12 residues, and it does not assemble into filaments in vitro; 2) the rate of \u03b1-synuclein polymerization in vitro decreases after the introduction of a single charged amino acid within these 12 residues, and a deletion within this region abrogates assembly; 3) this stretch of 12 amino acids appears to form the core of \u03b1-synuclein filaments, because it is resistant to proteolytic digestion in \u03b1-synuclein filaments; and 4) synthetic peptides corresponding to this 12-amino acid stretch self-polymerize to form filaments, and these peptides promote fibrillization of full-length human \u03b1-synuclein in vitro. Thus, we have identified key sequence elements necessary for the assembly of human \u03b1-synuclein into filaments, and these elements may be exploited as targets for the design of drugs that inhibit \u03b1-synuclein fibrillization and might arrest disease progression.

Thus, we have identified key sequence elements necessary for the assembly of human \u03b1-synuclein into filaments, and these elements may be exploited as targets for the design of drugs that inhibit \u03b1-synuclein fibrillization and might arrest disease progression. synuclein electron microscopy Lewy body nonamyloid component of amyloid plaques polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)1is the major component of several pathological lesions diagnostic of specific neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, the Lewy body (LB) variant of Alzheimer's disease, dementia with LB, multiple system atrophy, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type 1 (formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz disease; Refs. 1Baba M.

These proteins are more highly homologous within the amino-terminal half, which encompasses 5\u20136 degenerate KTKEGV repeats. Of these proteins, \u03b1-syn has the greatest sequence homology to \u03b2-syn. Furthermore, the expression and intracellular localization of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn are very similar in that both proteins are predominantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system and are concentrated at the presynaptic terminal (19Jakes R.

In contrast, \u03b3-syn is predominantly expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system, although it is also found at low levels in brain but diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (23Buchman V.L. Hunter H.J.A. Pino\u0303n L.G.P. Thompson J. Privalova E.M. Ninkina N.N. Davies A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9335-9341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synoretin is similar to \u03b3-syn with respect to amino acid sequence and intracellular distribution, but synoretin is mainly expressed in the retina (17Surguchov A. Surgucheva I. Solessio E.

Intriguingly, although \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn have sequence homology and very similar biological properties, \u03b1-syn, but not \u03b2-syn, is found in fibrillar pathological lesions (1Baba M.

To determine the reason for this difference, we compared the primary sequences of human \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn, and we recognized that a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids within the middle hydrophobic region of \u03b1-syn is lacking in \u03b2-syn and that there is a significant sequence divergence within the carboxyl-terminal region of these two proteins (Fig. 1). Deletion of amino acids 71\u201382 within the hydrophobic region abrogated the ability of human \u03b1-syn to polymerize, whereas the introduction of charged residues within the region significantly reduced the rate of filament formation. Conversely, substituting the carboxyl-terminal region of \u03b2-syn for that of \u03b1-syn did not affect polymerization. Proteolytic digestion of assembled \u03b1-syn as well as coassembly experiments with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the hydrophobic region further confirmed the key role of this region in fibrillogenesis. All synuclein cDNAs were subcloned into the NdeI andHindIII restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pRK172, and the respective proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in high-salt buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, heated to 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 70,000 \u00d7g for 30 min. The supernatants were applied onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and separated by size exclusion using high-salt buffer. The fractions were assayed for the presence of the synuclein proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The proteins were concentrated using Centriprep-10 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, applied to a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a 0\u20130.5 m NaCl gradient. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were resolved on slab gels by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) in buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked with a 1% solution of powdered skimmed milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with antibodies to \u03b1-syn and \u03b2-syn, followed by either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, developed with Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) and exposure onto X-Omat Blue XB-1 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Native and hybrid synuclein proteins were assembled into filaments by incubation at 37 \u00b0C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, with continuous shaking. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7g for 20 min, and SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) was added to pellets and supernatants, which were heated to 100 \u00b0C for 15 min. Synuclein proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. Assembled synuclein filaments were absorbed to 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized with a Joel (Peabody, MA) 1010 transmission electron microscope. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, MA) digital camera using AMT (Danvers, MA) software. For diameter determination, the width of 100\u2013120 filaments was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Del Mar, CA). Sixty \u03bcg of synuclein proteins in 30 \u03bcl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, were digested with 4.2 \u03bcg of proteinase K at 37 \u00b0C. At different time points, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer and heating to 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. Samples from each time point were resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Synuclein proteins prepared at a concentration of 5 mg\/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were analyzed by circular dichroism either immediately or after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days with constant shaking. Proteins were diluted 1:20 in distilled water and transferred to a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette, and the spectra between 190 and 260 nm were collected with a Aviv (Lakewood, NJ) 62DS spectrophotometer. The production and epitope mapping of anti-\u03b1-syn antibodies LB509, SNL-4, SNL-1, and Syn 208 and anti-\u03b2-syn antibody Syn 207 were reported previously (26Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M.

The rabbit anti-\u03b1-syn antibody NAC-1 was raised to a synthetic polypeptide (amino acids 75\u201391 in human \u03b1-syn) conjugated to maleimide activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The peptide VTGVTAVAQKTA corresponding to amino acids 71\u201382 in human \u03b1-syn (Fig.1) was synthesized and purified on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography by the Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University (New Haven, CT). The A76R and A76E \u03b1-syn DNAs were engineered by creating the respective nucleotide substitutions in the wild-type cDNA using complimentary sets of synthetic single-stranded DNA containing the mutant sequence (i.e. A76R primers, forward\/reverse, ACGGGTGTGACAAGAGTAGCCCAGAAGACAGTG\/CACTGTCTTCTGGGCTACTCTTGTCACACCCGT; and A76E primers, forward\/reverse, ACGGGTGTGACAGAAGTAGCCCAGAAGACAGTG\/CACTGTCTTCTGGGCTACTTCTGTCACACCCGT) and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The deletion of the nucleotide sequence coding for residues 71\u201382 in \u03b1-syn cDNA (Fig. 1) was created using the ExSite polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides that specifically bind to the DNA sequence adjacent to the targeted deleted sequence (GAGGGAGCAGGGAGCATTGCAGC and CACTGCTCCTCCAACATTTGTCACTTG). The cDNA encoding the hybrid protein \u03b1\/\u03b2-syn, which consist of amino acid residues 1\u201397 of \u03b1-syn and 87\u2013134 of \u03b2-syn (Fig. 1), was created by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides that amplified the two separate cDNA fragments of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn, respectively (\u03b1-syn, primer 1, CATATGGATGTATTCATGAAAGGAC; and primer 2, GAATTCCTCCTTTTTGACAAAGCCAGTGGCTG; \u03b2-syn, primer 3, TGTCAAAAAGGAGGAATTCCCTACTGATC; and primer 4, AGGGACAGAAGCTTGCTGCTGGTG). The inner oligonucleotides (primers 2 and 3) contain extended complimentary sequences that were used to unite both initial polymerase chain reaction products by subsequent polymerase chain reaction reactions with primers 1 and 4. The sequences of the constructs were verified using T7 primer and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as a service provided by the Nucleic Acid\/Protein Research Core Facility at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. To assess whether human \u03b2-syn is capable of self-assembly into filaments, we compared the ability of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn to form filaments using previously established conditions for the assembly of \u03b1-syn (12Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Centrifugal sedimentation analysis and electron microscopy (EM) were used to determine the assembly of human \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn. Both proteins were found in the soluble fraction before incubation for assembly (Fig.2 A), but the majority of \u03b1-syn was present in the pelletable fraction after 2 days of incubation, whereas \u03b2-syn remained largely soluble (Figs. 2,B and C, and 3). EM analysis showed that human \u03b1-syn filaments were abundant within 2 days (Fig. 4 A), but no fibrils could be detected with \u03b2-syn after incubation to induce fibrilization (data not shown). \u03b2-Syn failed to assemble even after 9 days in vitro, as demonstrated by quantitative sedimentation analysis of \u03b2-syn (Fig. 3). Further extensive EM inspection of grids coated with \u03b2-syn incubated under assembly conditions for up to 6 weeks did not reveal the presence of filaments. Finally, circular dichroism studies demonstrated that both proteins had random coiled conformations before assembly, but only \u03b1-syn acquired a \u03b2-pleated sheet conformation during assembly conditions (Fig. 5,A and C).Figure 3Quantification of synuclein filament assembly as analyzed by centrifugal sedimentation.

A stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the middle of \u03b1-syn is absent in \u03b2-syn (Fig. 1). Also, the carboxyl termini of the two proteins are relatively divergent compared with the amino termini. To ascertain the importance of the hydrophobic region and the carboxyl-terminal region in driving filament assembly, two types of recombinant synuclein protein were generated. First, amino acid residues 71\u201382 in human \u03b1-syn were deleted to generate a protein termed \u039471\u201382 (see Fig.1). Second, a hybrid comprising the first 97 amino acids of human \u03b1-syn and the last 48 amino acids of human \u03b2-syn was generated, termed \u03b1\/\u03b2-syn (Fig. 1). Before assembly, both recombinant proteins were recovered mainly in the supernatant after centrifugal sedimentation (Fig. 2 A) and had a predominantly random coil conformation (Fig. 5, A and B). On incubation, the assembly rate of \u03b1\/\u03b2-syn paralleled that of \u03b1-syn (Fig. 3), and it formed filaments of similar diameter and appearance (Fig. 4, compare A with B). The fibrillization of \u03b1\/\u03b2-syn also was associated with a change into a \u03b2-pleated sheet conformation (Fig. 5 D). On the other hand, \u039471\u201382 did not assemble under similar assembly conditions, as monitored by sedimentation analysis (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3), and transmission EM did not reveal the presence of filaments even after prolonged incubation for up to 6 weeks (data not shown). Finally, the lack of assembly was paralleled by a lack of conformational change, as detected by circular dichroism (Fig. 5 D). The possibility that \u03b2-syn or \u039471\u201382 could either coassemble with \u03b1-syn or inhibit the assembly of \u03b1-syn was determined by coassembly experiments. Neither \u03b2-syn nor \u039471\u201382 had any impact on the assembly of \u03b1-syn, as assayed by sedimentation (Fig. 2, Dand E) and by EM (data not shown). Furthermore, neither protein coassembled with \u03b1-syn. Although \u03b1-syn can be separated from \u03b2-syn by SDS-PAGE because of its greater mobility, the identity of the bands was also confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody specific to human \u03b1-syn (LB509) and an antibody specific to \u03b2-syn (Syn 207). To further confirm the importance of this hydrophobic region in fibrillogenesis, a single residue in the middle of this region, Ala-76, was substituted with either a positive (arginine) or a negative (glutamic acid) charge residue. Before assembly, the A76R and A76E mutations in recombinant \u03b1-syn proteins did not alter the normal random coil conformation of human \u03b1-syn in solution (Fig.5 B), and both recombinant proteins were in the soluble fraction when analyzed by centrifugal sedimentation (data not shown). The A76R mutation reduced the rate of filament formation when compared with wild-type \u03b1-syn at 2 days after assembly, but by 4 days the majority of the A76R protein was assembled (Figs. 2 F and 3). Fibrils comprising A76R \u03b1-syn (Fig. 4 C) were similar to those assembled of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the A76E mutation had a much greater impact on the rate of filament assembly. Even after 4 days of incubation, the mutant protein was predominantly found in the soluble fraction after sedimentation analysis (Figs. 2 F and 3), and only very rare and short fibrils were observed by EM (data not shown). However, after 9 days of assembly, the A76E \u03b1-syn protein eventually polymerized into fibrils that were morphologically indistinguishable from those generated from the wild-type protein (Fig. 4, compare A with D). The presence of either the A76R or A76E mutant in coassembly experiments did not seem to inhibit the assembly of wild-type protein, as assayed by sedimentation (Fig. 2 F), and observation by EM of grids coated with samples of both proteins coincubated for assembly (data not shown). Digestion of \u03b1-syn fibrils with proteinase K was used to identify regions that are probably buried within and therefore are core elements of these filaments. Digestion of unassembled human \u03b1-syn resulted in the rapid proteolysis of the protein within 30 min (Fig.6 A). Conversely, several lowerM r fragments, resistant to proteolysis, were detected when assembled \u03b1-syn filaments were treated with proteinase K for 0.5 h (Fig. 6 B). The acquired resistance to proteinase K was specific to assembled \u03b1-syn filaments, because two other proteins that are assembly incompetent, \u03b2-syn and \u0394 71\u201382, were completely digested even after assembly incubation (Fig.6 C). To identify the proteolytic resistant polypeptides, Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies with defined epitopes throughout the \u03b1-syn molecule (Fig. 6, D andE), and the approximate sequences of the three major polypeptides, designated F1\u2013F3, were deduced on the basis of their immunoreactivity with the different antibodies and their apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 6, D andE). All three peptides contain amino acid residues 71\u201382 within the middle hydrophobic region of \u03b1-syn. To further assess the importance of amino acids 71\u201382 in human \u03b1-syn for fibrillization, we asked whether synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence self-assemble into fibrils. Fig. 4 E shows that peptide 71\u201382 polymerizes into filaments, but these filaments are much straighter than those assembled from the full-length \u03b1-syn (Fig. 4, compare A with E). However, when full-length \u03b1-syn was assembled in the presence of peptide 71\u201382, only the more serginous fibrils, typical of full-length \u03b1-syn, were observed, suggesting that this peptide was incorporated into the same fibrils as full-length \u03b1-syn (Fig. 4 F). On a molar basis, peptide 71\u201382 is less efficiently assembled than full-length \u03b1-syn; nevertheless, its ability to self-assemble can also be observed by light scattering (Fig. 7 A). Finally, the addition of peptide 71\u201382 was found to enhance the assembly of full-length \u03b1-syn. After a 48-h incubation period, with less vigorous agitation to reduce the rate of assembly, the majority of \u03b1-syn when assembled alone was recovered in the supernatant, whereas in the presence of peptide 71\u201382, \u03b1-syn was found primarily in the pellet after sedimentation analysis (Fig. 7). Our study used a number of different assays to show that amino acid residues 71\u201382 within the middle of the hydrophobic domain of \u03b1-syn are necessary and sufficient for \u03b1-syn to polymerize into filaments. The importance of residues 71\u201382 for filament formation was realized when we found that human \u03b1-syn demonstrates an intrinsic ability to assemble into filaments, whereas human \u03b2-syn cannot polymerize into filaments even after prolonged (6 weeks) exposure to assembly conditions. These results are consistent with a recent report (28Biere, A. L., Wood, S. J., Wypych, J., Steavenson, S., Jiang, Y., Anafi, D., Jacobsen, F. W., Jarosinski, M. A., Wu, G. M., Louis, J.-C., Martin, F., Narhi, L. O., and Citron, M.J. Biol. Chem. 275,34574\u201334579Google Scholar). However, it cannot be completely excluded that \u03b2-syn would never form filaments under any circumstances, because another study suggested that a small number of \u03b2-syn filaments were observed after 5 weeks of incubation (29Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Although we did observe a slight increase in the amount of pelletable \u03b2-syn after prolonged incubation (Fig.3), we attributed this to nonspecific aggregation because of the lack of visible filaments by EM. Taken together, these findings indicate that \u03b2-syn is far less prone to polymerize into fibrils relative to \u03b1-syn. We sought to explain the dramatic difference in assembly properties of human \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn by comparing their sequences, which revealed two major differences: 1) \u03b2-syn lacks a hydrophobic amino acid stretch found near the middle region of \u03b1-syn; and 2) the carboxyl termini of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn are significantly divergent. The ability of a hybrid protein containing the amino terminus of \u03b1-syn and the carboxyl terminus of \u03b2-syn to assemble into filaments demonstrates that differences within the carboxyl-terminal region of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn do not account for the paucity of filament formation by \u03b2-syn. Conversely, a 12-amino acid deletion of the middle hydrophobic region within \u03b1-syn (\u039471\u201382) obliterated polymerization. The importance of the hydrophobic region is further supported by the inhibitory influences of the substitution of a single uncharged amino acid to a charged residue (either Glu or Arg). The introduction of either of these single substitutions did not completely inhibit assembly, but it did slow down the rate of filament assembly, especially the A76E mutation. Thus, these results demonstrate that the introduction of a single charged residue is not sufficient to disrupt the hydrophobic intermolecular interactions driving filament formation. Protection of unassembled and assembled \u03b1-syn from proteinase K digestion was used to screen for segments of the protein buried in the core, because they are likely to be involved in filament assembly. Three predominant proteolytic resistant fragments (F1\u2013F3) were observed. These fragments mapped to the middle hydrophobic region and contained amino acids 61\u201395, which has also been termed the nonamyloid component (NAC) of A\u03b2 amyloid plaques (30Ue\u0301da K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The NAC peptide was initially purified from SDS-insoluble fractions enriched in amyloid cores from Alzheimer's disease brains, and it was thought to be the second most abundant component of plaques after \u03b2-amyloid. Whether this peptide is actually an intrinsic component of amyloid plaques is still a matter of contention (30Ue\u0301da K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A.C. Kondo J.

Beyreuther K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 266: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It may have been purified as a contaminant of amyloid cores, since almost all brains from Alzheimer's disease patients contain variable amounts of aggregated \u03b1-syn in LBs and in Lewy neurites. The proteolytic resistance of this region within fibrillar \u03b1-syn shown in our study may explain why the NAC peptide was selectively recovered with amyloid cores, since both NAC and A\u03b2 may be resilient to proteolysis by endogenous proteases during purification or to the protease that was used in the final stage of purification. To further confirm the role of the hydrophobic region in the polymerization of \u03b1-syn, a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 71\u201382 in human \u03b1-syn was assayed for its ability to generate filaments and to coassemble with full-length \u03b1-syn. Peptide 71\u201382 readily self-assembled under the same conditions used for \u03b1-syn, and it further promoted the assembly of \u03b1-syn. Consistent with these results and the notion that the hydrophobic region is essential for assembly, it was reported that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1\u201318 in NAC (i.e. 61\u201378 in \u03b1-syn) can also form filaments, but not a peptide corresponding to amino acids 19\u201335 in NAC (i.e. 79\u201395 in \u03b1-syn; Ref. 34El-Agnaf O.M.A. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a carboxyl-terminal \u03b1-syn truncation mutant (1\u201389) not only formed filaments, it actually assembled faster than full-length \u03b1-syn (29Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies raise the possibility that aberrant proteolysis of \u03b1-syn and the accumulation of a polypeptide constituting the hydrophobic region may act together as a nidus for the formation of large inclusions. Indeed, LBs isolated from dementia with LB brains contain truncated \u03b1-syn fragments (1Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). The inefficiency of \u03b2-syn to form filaments likely explains the paucity of \u03b2-syn within pathological lesions defined by \u03b1-syn immunoreactivity. The only exception is a recent study (35Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13450-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) in which an accumulation of both \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn was observed in mossy fibers terminals that synapse on hilar neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease or dementia with LB. However, this pathology is different from other \u03b1-syn lesions, because it is not defined by the presence of abundant fibrils as seen in LBs and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The accumulation of \u03b1- and \u03b2-syn in synaptic terminals is likely attributable to the degeneration of presynaptic terminals independent of \u03b1-syn fibrillogenesis, a notion that is consistent with the accumulation of other synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, synapsin, and synaptobrevin (35Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13450-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the protein motifs required in the fibrillogenesis and subsequent formation of pathological inclusions is critical to plan potentially effective therapeutic strategies targeted at reducing the formation of pathological \u03b1-syn aggregation. Candidates for such therapy may include small molecules that could interfere with the assembly process by binding to the hydrophobic region. However, as demonstrated by the peptide corresponding to amino acids 71\u201382 in human \u03b1-syn, such treatments could produce an effect opposite to that desired by increasing aggregation. Pharmacological agents that could prevent \u03b1-syn from converting into a \u03b2-pleated sheet conformation may be effective. Indeed, this structural alteration is associated with filament formation in vitro, and pathologically aggregated \u03b1-syn is also likely to be in a \u03b2-sheet conformation, as suggested by the staining of pathological lesions with thioflavin S (36Duda J.E. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).

Surface features, or pores, became evident when electrospinning in an atmosphere with more than 30% relative humidity. Increasing humidity causes an increase in the number, diameter, shape, and distribution of the pores. Increasing the molecular weight of the polystyrene (PS) results in larger, less uniform shaped pores.

A substantial amount of atmospheric carbon taken up on land is transported laterally from upland terrestrial ecosystems to the ocean. A synthesis of the available literature suggests that human activities have significantly increased soil carbon inputs to inland waters, but have only slightly affected carbon delivery to the open ocean. A substantial amount of the atmospheric carbon taken up on land through photosynthesis and chemical weathering is transported laterally along the aquatic continuum from upland terrestrial ecosystems to the ocean. So far, global carbon budget estimates have implicitly assumed that the transformation and lateral transport of carbon along this aquatic continuum has remained unchanged since pre-industrial times. A synthesis of published work reveals the magnitude of present-day lateral carbon fluxes from land to ocean, and the extent to which human activities have altered these fluxes. We show that anthropogenic perturbation may have increased the flux of carbon to inland waters by as much as 1.0 Pg C yr\u22121 since pre-industrial times, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils. Most of this additional carbon input to upstream rivers is either emitted back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (\u223c0.4 Pg C yr\u22121) or sequestered in sediments (\u223c0.5 Pg C yr\u22121) along the continuum of freshwater bodies, estuaries and coastal waters, leaving only a perturbation carbon input of \u223c0.1 Pg C yr\u22121 to the open ocean. According to our analysis, terrestrial ecosystems store \u223c0.9 Pg C yr\u22121 at present, which is in agreement with results from forest inventories but significantly differs from the figure of 1.5 Pg C yr\u22121 previously estimated when ignoring changes in lateral carbon fluxes.

Phytochemicals could provide health benefits as: (1) substrates for biochemical reactions; (2) cofactors of enzymatic reactions; (3) inhibitors of enzymatic reactions; (4) absorbents\/sequestrants that bind to and eliminate undesirable constituents in the intestine; (5) ligands that agonize or antagonize cell surface or intracellular receptors; (6) scavengers of reactive or toxic chemicals; (7) compounds that enhance the absorption and or stability of essential nutrients; (8) selective growth factors for beneficial gastrointestinal bacteria; (9) fermentation substrates for beneficial oral, gastric or intestinal bacteria; and (10) selective inhibitors of deleterious intestinal bacteria. Such phytochemicals include terpenoids, phenolics, alkaloids and fiber. Research supporting beneficial roles for phytochemicals against cancers, coronary heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, inflammation, microbial, viral and parasitic infections, psychotic diseases, spasmodic conditions, ulcers, etc is based on chemical mechanisms using in vitro and cell culture systems, various disease states in animals and epidemiology of humans.

We describe here the ecological and evolutionary processes that modulate the effects of invasive species over time, and argue that such processes are so widespread and important that ecologists should adopt a long-term perspective on the effects of invasive species. These processes (including evolution, shifts in species composition, accumulation of materials and interactions with abiotic variables) can increase, decrease, or qualitatively change the impacts of an invader through time. However, most studies of the effects of invasive species have been brief and lack a temporal context; 40% of recent studies did not even state the amount of time that had passed since the invasion. Ecologists need theory and empirical data to enable prediction, understanding and management of the acute and chronic effects of species invasions.",

    "text":"Understanding the influence of suspended solids on water quality and aquatic biota. Over the last 50 years the effects of suspended solids (SS) on fish and aquatic life have been studied intensively throughout the world. It is now accepted that SS are an extremely important cause of water quality deterioration leading to aesthetic issues, higher costs of water treatment, a decline in the fisheries resource, and serious ecological degradation of aquatic environments. As such, government-led environmental bodies have set recommended water quality guidelines for concentrations of SS in freshwater systems. However, these reference values are often spurious or based on the concept of turbidity as a surrogate measure of the concentration of SS. The appropriateness of these recommended water quality values is evaluated given: (1) the large variability and uncertainty in data available from research describing the effects of SS on aquatic environments, (2) the diversity of environments that these values are expected to relate to, and (3) the range of conditions experienced within these environments. Furthermore, we suggest that reliance solely upon turbidity data as a surrogate for SS must be treated with caution, as turbidity readings respond to factors other than just concentrations of SS, as well as being influenced by the particle-size distribution and shape of SS particles. In addition, turbidity is a measure of only one of the many detrimental effects, reviewed in this paper, which high levels of SS can have in waterbodies. In order to improve the understanding of the effects of SS on aquatic organisms, this review suggests that: First, high-resolution turbidity monitoring should be supplemented with direct, measurements of SS (albeit at lower resolution due to resource issues). This would allow the turbidity record to be checked and calibrated against SS, effectively building a rating-relationship between SS and turbidity, which would in-turn provide a clearer picture of the exact magnitude of the SS problem. Second, SS should also be characterised in terms of their particle-size distribution and chemical composition. This would provide information to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the observed variable effects of a given concentration of SS in aquatic habitats. These two suggested improvements, combined with lower-resolution concurrent measures of aquatic ecological status, would improve our understanding of the effects of SS in aquatic environments and together with a more detailed classification of aquatic environments, would provide an environment-specific evidence base for the establishment of effective water quality guidelines for SS.",

    "text":"Hydrogen from renewable electricity: An international review of power-to-gas pilot plants for stationary applications. Abstract An increasingly large percentage of power is being generated from renewable energy sources with intermittent and fluctuating outputs. Therefore there is a growing need for energy storage. With power-to-gas, excess electricity is converted into hydrogen by water electrolysis, which can be stored and, when needed, can be reconverted into electricity with fuel cells. Besides the energy vector for electricity, mobility and heat, hydrogen can be utilized as a raw material for the chemical industry or further be used for the synthesis of various hydrocarbon fuels such as methane. This article is an international review of numerous power-to-gas pilot plants that have either already been realized or are being planned. It provides information about their installed components and capacities as well as about operating experience that has been had with them. In many of the projects it was concluded that the design and sizing, control strategy and system integration of the power-to-gas plants have a great influence on their overall efficiency, reliability and economics. Topics for further research are the improvement of the efficiency, reliability, lifetime and costs of electrolyzers and fuel cells and better ways of dealing with power sources. In order to improve the overall performance, the reduction of auxiliary equipment and the continuous long-term operation of power-to-gas pilot plants will be necessary. The further development of codes and standards for permits to operate, as well as of hydrogen components and control strategies, would bring additional benefits for power-to-gas systems. It is also recommended that optimum system configurations and components be determined with regard to the available infrastructure and the type of application involved.",

Because of its ability to exist in one of two oxidation states, iron is an ideal redox catalyst for diverse cellular processes including respiration and DNA replication. However, the redox potential of iron also contributes to its toxicity; thus, iron concentration and distribution must be carefully controlled. Given the absolute requirement for iron by virtually all human pathogens, an important facet of the innate immune system is to limit iron availability to invading microbes in a process termed nutritional immunity. Successful human pathogens must therefore possess mechanisms to circumvent nutritional immunity in order to cause disease.

Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50\/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.",

Manganese oxides of various structures (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b4-MnO2 and amorphous) were synthesized by facile methods. The electrocatalytic properties of these materials were systematically investigated for catalyzing both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Extensive characterization was correlated with the activity study by investigating the crystal structures (XRD, HRTEM), morphologies (SEM), porosities (BET), surfaces (XPS, O2-TPD\/MS), and electrochemical properties (Tafel analysis, Koutechy\u2013Levich plots, and constant-current electrolysis). These combined results show that the electrocatalytic activities are strongly dependent on the crystallographic structures, and follow an order of \u03b1-MnO2 > AMO > \u03b2-MnO2 > \u03b4-MnO2. Both OER studies and ORR studies reveal similar structure-determined activity trends in alkaline media. In the OER studies, \u03b1-MnO2 displays an overpotential of 490 mV compared to 380 mV shown by an Ir\/C catalyst in reaching 10 mA cm\u20132. Meanwhile, \u03b1-MnO2 also exhibits stability for 3 h when supplying a constant current density of 5 mA cm\u20132. This was further improved by adding Ni2+ dopants (ca. 8 h). The superior OER activity was attributed to several factors, including abundant di-\u03bc-oxo bridges existing in \u03b1-MnO2 as the protonation sites, analogous to the OEC in PS-II of the natural water oxidation system; the mixed valencies (AOS = 3.7); and the lowest charge transfer resistances (91.8 \u03a9, \u03b7 = 430 mV) as revealed from in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the ORR studies, when reaching 3 mA cm\u20132, \u03b1-MnO2 shows 760 mV close to 860 mV for the best ORR catalyst (20% Pt\/C). The outstanding ORR activity was due to the strongest O2 adsorption capability of \u03b1-MnO2 suggested by temperature-programmed desorption. As a result, this discovery of the structure-related electrocatalytic activities could provide guidance in the further development of easily prepared, scalable, and low-cost catalysts based on metal oxides and their derivatives.",

In this review, recent advances towards understanding these properties are described. Information is presented on the ten most potently antibacterial flavonoids as well as the five most synergistic flavonoid\u2013antibiotic combinations tested in the last 6 years (identified from PubMed and ScienceDirect).

In addition to direct and synergistic activities, flavonoids inhibit a number of bacterial virulence factors, including quorum-sensing signal receptors, enzymes and toxins. Evidence of these molecular effects at the cellular level include in vitro inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of bacterial attachment to host ligands, and neutralisation of toxicity towards cultured human cells.

To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In plant communities, changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in species richness.

Textural characterization of the porous carbons showed that the samples obtained under mild activating conditions exhibit smaller surface areas and pore sizes than those prepared by employing a greater amount of KOH.

Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e.g. leaf area index, age), as well as ancillary site information such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics. This publicly available database can be used to quantify global, regional or biome-specific carbon budgets; to re-examine established relationships; to test emerging hypotheses about ecosystem functioning [e.g. a constant net ecosystem production (NEP) to gross primary production (GPP) ratio]; and as benchmarks for model evaluations.

We discuss the climatic influences on GPP, net primary production (NPP) and NEP and present the CO2 balances for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes based on micrometeorological, ecophysiological, and biometric flux and inventory estimates. Globally, GPP of forests benefited from higher temperatures and precipitation whereas NPP saturated above either a threshold of 1500 mm precipitation or a mean annual temperature of 10 \u00b0C. The global pattern in NEP was insensitive to climate and is hypothesized to be mainly determined by nonclimatic conditions such as successional stage, management, site history, and site disturbance.

Since water and nitrate enter deeper soil strata over time and are initially depleted in surface soil strata, root systems with rapid exploitation of deep soil would optimize water and N capture in most maize production environments. \u2022 THE IDEOTYPE: Specific phenes that may contribute to rooting depth in maize include (a) a large diameter primary root with few but long laterals and tolerance of cold soil temperatures, (b) many seminal roots with shallow growth angles, small diameter, many laterals, and long root hairs, or as an alternative, an intermediate number of seminal roots with steep growth angles, large diameter, and few laterals coupled with abundant lateral branching of the initial crown roots, (c) an intermediate number of crown roots with steep growth angles, and few but long laterals, (d) one whorl of brace roots of high occupancy, having a growth angle that is slightly shallower than the growth angle for crown roots, with few but long laterals, (e) low cortical respiratory burden created by abundant cortical aerenchyma, large cortical cell size, an optimal number of cells per cortical file, and accelerated cortical senescence, (f) unresponsiveness of lateral branching to localized resource availability, and (g) low K(m) and high Vmax for nitrate uptake. Some elements of this ideotype have experimental support, others are hypothetical.

    "text":"Nutrient Excess and the Demise of Coral Reefs and Carbonate Platforms. Growth rates of corals on Holocene reefs indicate that carbonate platforms should easily keep pace with long-term subsidence and sea-level changes, yet drowned reefs and platforms are common in the geologic record. Recognition of the negative influence of nutrients on reef communities provides a clue to that paradox. The primary carbonate-sediment producers of the coral reef community are highly adapted to nutrient-deficient environments. Input of nitrates and phosphates stimulates growth of plankton, which reduces water transparency, limiting depth ranges of zooxanthellate corals and calcareous algae and thereby reducing carbonate production. Higher nutrient concentrations and plankton densities also stimulate growth of fleshy algae and ahermatypic suspension-feeding animals in the benthos. Besides displacing hermatypic algae and corals, many of these fastgrowing competitors are bioeroders that actively destroy thze reefal structure. Because rates of carbonate production and bioerosion are similar, even modest increases in nutrient availability can shift a reef community from net production to net erosion. In the geologic record, drowned reefs and carbonate platforms typically exhibit evidence of nondeposition, bioerosion, and reduced redox potential, which indicate excess nutrient availability during drowning. Drowned reefs overlain by shales are possible victims of nutrients in terrestrial runoff that suppressed reef growth before arrival of siliciclastic sediments. Other drowned platforms may have succumbed during rapid pulses of sea-level rise that flooded previously subaerial platforms. Nutrients in the soils of the flooding platform were mixed into surface waters, suppressing reef growth. The reef drowned if submergence proceeded beyond the critical depth before the excess nutrients were exported from the system. Other mechanisms for reef drowning by excess nutrients include changes in local or regional upwelling patterns or mid-ocean overturn.",

    "text":"Constitutive modeling of the large strain time-dependent behavior of elastomers. Abstract The mechanical behavior of elastomeric materials is known to be rate-dependent and to exhibit hysteresis upon cyclic loading. Although these features of the rubbery constitutive response are well-recognized and important to its function, few models attempt to quantify these aspects of response perhaps due to the complex nature of the behavior and its apparent inconsistency with regard to current reasonably successful models of rubber elasticity. In this paper a detailed experimental investigation probing the material response of carbon black filled Chloroprene rubber subjected to different time-dependent strain histories is presented. Some of the key observations from the experiments are: (1) both filled and unfilled elastomers show significant amounts of hysteresis during cyclic loading; (2) the amount of carbon black particles does not strongly influence the normalized amount of hysteresis; (3) both filled and unfilled elastomers are strain-rate dependent and the rate dependence is higher during the uploading than during the unloading; (4) at fixed strain, the stress is observed to approach the same equilibrium level with relaxation time whether loading or unloading. Based on the experimental data a new constitutive model has been developed. The foundation of the model is that the mechanical behavior can be decomposed into two parts: an equilibrium network corresponding to the state that is approached in long time stress relaxation tests; and a second network capturing the non-linear rate-dependent deviation from the equilibrium state. The time-dependence of the second network is further assumed to be governed by the reptational motion of molecules having the ability to significantly change conformation and thereby relaxing the overall stress state. By comparing the predictions from the proposed three-dimensional constitutive model with experimental data for uniaxial compression and plane strain compression we conclude that the constitutive model predicts rate-dependence and relaxation behavior well.",

In Paul Lake, the reference lake, productivity varied from year to year, illustrating the effects of climatic factors and the natural dynamics of unmanipulated food web interactions. In Tuesday Lake, piscivore addition and planktivore reduction caused an increase in zooplankton biomass, a compositional shift from a copepod\/rotifer assemblage to a cladoceran assemblage, a reduction in algal biomass, and a continuous reduction in primary productivity. In Peter Lake, piscivore reduction and planktivore addition decreased zooplanktivory, because potential planktivores remained in littoral refugia to escape from remaining piscivores. Both zooplankton biomass and the dominance of large cladocerans increased. Algal biomass and primary production increased because of increased concentrations of gelatinous colonial green algae. Food web effects and abiotic factors were equally potent regulators of primary production in these experiments.

    "text":"Climate and wildfire area burned in western U.S. ecoprovinces, 1916\u20132003. The purpose of this paper is to quantify climatic controls on the area burned by fire in different vegetation types in the western United States. We demonstrate that wildfire area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass- and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed fire-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on fire regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate-fire relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of fire suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate fire vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe fires under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned.",

    "text":"Carbon allocation in forest ecosystems. Carbon allocation plays a critical role in forest ecosystem carbon cycling. We reviewed existing literature and compiled annual carbon budgets for forest ecosystems to test a series of hypotheses addressing the patterns, plasticity, and limits of three components of allocation: biomass, the amount of material present; flux, the flow of carbon to a component per unit time; and partitioning, the fraction of gross primary productivity (GPP) used by a component. Can annual carbon flux and partitioning be inferred from biomass? Our survey revealed that biomass was poorly related to carbon flux and to partitioning of photosynthetically derived carbon, and should not be used to infer either. Are component fluxes correlated? Carbon fluxes to foliage, wood, and belowground production and respiration all increased linearly with increasing GPP (a rising tide lifts all boats). Autotrophic respiration was strongly linked to production for foliage, wood and roots, and aboveground net primary productivity and total belowground carbon flux (TBCF) were positively correlated across a broad productivity gradient. How does carbon partitioning respond to variability in resources and environment? Within sites, partitioning to aboveground wood production and TBCF responded to changes in stand age and resource availability, but not to competition (tree density). Increasing resource supply and stand age, with one exception, resulted in increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to TBCF. Partitioning to foliage production was much less sensitive to changes in resources and environment. Overall, changes in partitioning within a site in response to resource supply and age were small (<15% of GPP), but much greater than those inferred from global relationships. Across all sites, foliage production plus respiration, and total autotrophic respiration appear to use relatively constant fractions of GPP \u2013 partitioning to both was conservative across a broad range of GPP \u2013 but values did vary across sites. Partitioning to aboveground wood production and to TBCF were the most variable \u2013 conditions that favored high GPP increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to TBCF. Do priorities exist for the products of photosynthesis? The available data do not support the concept of priorities for the products of photosynthesis, because increasing GPP increased all fluxes. All facets of carbon allocation are important to understanding carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystem models require information on partitioning, yet we found few studies that measured all components of the carbon budget to allow estimation of partitioning coefficients. Future studies that measure complete annual carbon budgets contribute the most to understanding carbon allocation.",

Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 394-407 Abstract Mycorrhizal fungi influence plant growth, local biodiversity and ecosystem function. Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta-analysis with information theory-based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group and N-fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation ('plant response') than other factors. Non-N-fixing forbs and woody plants and C(4) grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N-fixing bacterial symbionts and C(3) grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P-limited rather than N-limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology.",

Markers of inhibitory neurotransmission are altered in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of subjects with schizophrenia, and several lines of evidence suggest that these alterations may be most prominent in the subset of GABA-containing neurons that express the calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin (PV). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of mRNAs for PV, another calcium-binding protein, calretinin (CR), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in postmortem brain specimens from 15 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and matched control subjects using single- and dual-label in situ hybridization. Signal intensity for PV mRNA expression in PFC area 9 was significantly decreased in the subjects with schizophrenia, predominantly in layers III and IV. Analysis at the cellular level revealed that this decrease was attributable principally to a reduction in PV mRNA expression per neuron rather than by a decreased density of PV mRNA-positive neurons. In contrast, the same measures of CR mRNA expression were not altered in schizophrenia. These findings were confirmed by findings from cDNA microarray studies using different probes. Across the subjects with schizophrenia, the decrease in neuronal PV mRNA expression was highly associated (r = 0.84) with the decrease in the density of neurons containing detectable levels of GAD67 mRNA. Furthermore, simultaneous detection of PV and GAD67 mRNAs revealed that in subjects with schizophrenia only 55% of PV mRNA-positive neurons had detectable levels of GAD67 mRNA. Given the critical role that PV-containing GABA neurons appear to play in regulating the cognitive functions mediated by the PFC, the selective alterations in gene expression in these neurons may contribute to the cognitive deficits characteristic of schizophrenia.",

Of the three options of reducing the global energy use, developing low or no-carbon fuel and sequestering emissions, this manuscript describes processes for carbon (CO2) sequestration and discusses abiotic and biotic technologies. Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO2 into other long-lived global pools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Engineering techniques of CO2 injection in deep ocean, geological strata, old coal mines and oil wells, and saline aquifers along with mineral carbonation of CO2 constitute abiotic techniques. These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakage risks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques are natural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary benefits, are immediately applicable but have finite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have specific nitches, are complementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.",

    "text":"The Human Plasma Proteome. We have merged four different views of the human plasma proteome, based on different methodologies, into a single nonredundant list of 1175 distinct gene products. The methodologies used were 1) literature search for proteins reported to occur in plasma or serum; 2) multidimensional chromatography of proteins followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy (MS) identification of resolved proteins; 3) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides followed by MS identification; and 4) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides from low-molecular-mass plasma components followed by MS identification. Of 1,175 nonredundant gene products, 195 were included in more than one of the four input datasets. Only 46 appeared in all four. Predictions of signal sequence and transmembrane domain occurrence, as well as Genome Ontology annotation assignments, allowed characterization of the nonredundant list and comparison of the data sources. The \u201cnonproteomic\u201d literature (468 input proteins) is strongly biased toward signal sequence-containing extracellular proteins, while the three proteomics methods showed a much higher representation of cellular proteins, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and kinesin complex proteins. Cytokines and protein hormones were almost completely absent from the proteomics data (presumably due to low abundance), while categories like DNA-binding proteins were almost entirely absent from the literature data (perhaps unexpected and therefore not sought). Most major categories of proteins in the human proteome are represented in plasma, with the distribution at successively deeper layers shifting from mostly extracellular to a distribution more like the whole (primarily cellular) proteome. The resulting nonredundant list confirms the presence of a number of interesting candidate marker proteins in plasma and serum.

The resulting nonredundant list confirms the presence of a number of interesting candidate marker proteins in plasma and serum. The human plasma proteome is likely to contain most, if not all, human proteins, as well as proteins derived from some viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Many of the human proteins, introduced by low-level tissue leakage, ought to be present at very low concentrations (\u226apg\/ml), while others, such as albumin, are present in very large amounts (\u226bmg\/ml). Numerous post-translationally modified forms of each protein are likely to be present, along with literally millions of distinct clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) 1The abbreviations used are: Ig, immunoglobulin; MS, mass spectrometry; GO, Genome Ontology; 2DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis; NR, nonredundant; TM, transmembrane; LC, liquid chromatography; MS\/MS, tandem MS; IT, ion trap.1The abbreviations used are: Ig, immunoglobulin; MS, mass spectrometry; GO, Genome Ontology; 2DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis; NR, nonredundant; TM, transmembrane; LC, liquid chromatography; MS\/MS, tandem MS; IT, ion trap. sequences. This complexity and enormous dynamic range make plasma the most difficult specimen to be dealt with by proteomics (1Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. The human plasma proteome: History, character, and diagnostic prospects..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 845-867Google Scholar). At the same time, plasma is the most generally informative proteome from a medical viewpoint. Almost all cells in the body communicate with plasma directly or through extracellular or cerebrospinal fluids, and many release at least part of their contents into plasma upon damage or death. Some medical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, are officially defined based on the increase of a specific protein in the plasma (e.g. cardiac troponin-T), and it is difficult to argue convincingly that there is any disease state that does not produce some specific pattern of protein change in the body\u2019s working fluid. This immense diagnostic potential has spurred a rapid acceleration in the search for protein disease markers by a wide variety of proteomics strategies. Current methods of proteomics are only beginning to catalog the contents of plasma. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was able to resolve 40 distinct plasma proteins in 1976 (2Anderson L. Anderson N.G. High resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis of human plasma proteins..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5421-5425Google Scholar), but, because of the dynamic range problem, this number had only grown to 60 in 1992 (3Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Paquet N. Ravier F Pasquali C. Sanchez J.C. James R. Tissot J.D. Bjellqvist B. Hochstrasser D.F. Plasma protein map: An update by microsequencing..Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 707-714Google Scholar) and is substantially unchanged today, a quarter century later. It is now clear that more than two dimensions of conventional resolution are required to progress beyond this point. Recently, several truly multidimensional survey efforts have been mounted, with the result that the number of distinct proteins detected has increased dramatically. Additional dimensions of separation can be introduced at any of three levels: a) separation of intact proteins, either by specific binding (e.g. subtraction of defined high-abundance proteins) or continuous resolution (e.g. electrophoresis or chromatography); b) separation of peptides derived from plasma proteins, either by specific binding (e.g. capture by anti-peptide antibodies) or continuous resolution (e.g. chromatography); and c) separation of peptides, and particularly their fragments, by mass spectrometry (MS). Many possible combinations of these dimensions can be implemented, the only limitations being the effort, cost, and time of analyzing many fractions or runs instead of one. In this article, we have compared and combined data from three different multi-dimensional strategies with data from a fourth, classical source (the protein biochemistry and clinical chemistry literature) to provide a meta-level overview of both the contents and the rate of discovery of new components in plasma. The three experimental datasets are derived from 1) whole protein separation by a three-dimensional process (immunosubtraction\/ion exchange\/size exclusion) followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) followed by MS identification of resolved spots (4Pieper R. Su Q. Gatlin C.L. Huang S.T. Anderson N.L. Steiner S. Multi-component immunoaffinity subtraction chromatography: An innovative step towards a comprehensive survey of the human plasma proteome..Proteomics. 2003; 3: 422-432Google Scholar); 2) Ig subtraction followed by trypsin digestion followed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC) (ion exchange\/reversed phase) followed by tandem MS (MS\/MS) (5Adkins J.N. Varnum S.M. Auberry K.J. Moore R.J. Angell N.H. Smith R.D. Springer D.L. Pounds J.G. Toward a human blood serum proteome: Analysis by multidimensional separation coupled with mass spectrometry..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 947-955Google Scholar); and 3) molecular mass fractionation, followed by trypsin digestion followed by two-dimensional LC (cation exchange\/reversed phase) followed by MS\/MS (6Tirumalai R.S. Chan K.C. Prieto D.A. Issaq H.J. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Characterization of the low molecular weight human serum proteome..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1096-1103Google Scholar). These three experimental approaches have two features in common (the removal of most Igs, by specific subtraction or size, and the use of MS for molecular identification) but otherwise they span the gamut of proteomics discovery approaches: separation at the protein level, separation at the tryptic peptide level, and a hybrid. Combining experimental data with literature search results on proteins detected in plasma (representing a large body of accumulated \u201cnonproteomics\u201d data) should provide a broad perspective on plasma contents. Because the same proteins detected by various methods can be referred to by different names or accession numbers, we have used a sequence-based approach to eliminate redundancy and cluster all occurrences of the same protein. The resulting list makes it possible to examine the overlap between the various approaches and to see whether they are biased toward particular classes of proteins. In addition, a pooled nonredundant list should provide a relatively unbiased survey of the kinds of proteins present in plasma, which could have important diagnostic implications. Finally, a large list of proteins actually observed in plasma paves the way for top-down, targeted proteomics approaches to the discovery of disease markers: the development of accurate high-throughput specific assays for selected candidates from this list, as a supplement to the use of single methods for marker discovery in small sample sets. In the longer term, proteins with strong, mechanistic disease relationships may be viable therapeutic candidates as well. Manual Medline searches were performed searching for titles or abstracts containing human plasma or serum proteins, excluding articles on membranes, stimulation, drug, and dose. A total of 468 entries were collected, of which 458 had a human sequence accession number in one or more of the major databases. Intact proteins were fractionated by chromatography and 2DE and identified by MS, generating the dataset described by Pieper et al. (7Pieper R. Gatlin C.L. Makusky A.J. Russo P.S. Schatz C.R. Miller S.S. Su Q. McGrath A.M. Estock M.A. Parmar P.P. Zhao M. Huang S.T. Zhou J. Wang F. Esquer-Blasco R. Anderson N.L. Taylor J. Steiner S. The human serum proteome: Display of nearly 3700 chromatographically separated protein spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels and identification of 325 distinct proteins..Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1345-1364Google Scholar). Briefly, human blood sera were obtained in equal volumes from two healthy male donors (ages 40 and 80). Albumin, haptoglobin, transferrin, transthyretin, \u03b1-1-anti trypsin, \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein, hemopexin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography. The immunoaffinity-subtracted serum concentrate was fractionated further by sequential anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. The resulting 66 samples were individually subjected to 2DE. All visible Coomassie Blue R250 spots were cut out, destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. All extracted peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) on a Bruker Biflex or Autoflex mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) and searched against Swiss-Prot. Those samples that did not give positive identification by MALDI-TOF where subjected to LC-MS\/MS analysis by ion trap (IT) MS (Thermo Finnegan LCQ, Woburn, MA) and searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using SEQUEST. A published dataset prepared by Adkins et al., (5Adkins J.N. Varnum S.M. Auberry K.J. Moore R.J. Angell N.H. Smith R.D. Springer D.L. Pounds J.G. Toward a human blood serum proteome: Analysis by multidimensional separation coupled with mass spectrometry..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 947-955Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, human blood serum was obtained from a healthy anonymous female donor. Igs were depleted by affinity adsorption chromatography using protein A\/G. The resulting Ig-depleted plasma was digested with trypsin and separated by strong cation exchange on a polysulfoethyl A column followed by reverse-phase separation on a capillary C18 column. The capillary column was interfaced to an IT-MS (Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP) using electrospray ionization. The IT-MS was configured to perform MS\/MS scans on the three most intense precursor masses from a single MS scan. All samples were measured over a mass\/charge (m\/z) range of 400\u20132,000, with fractions containing high complexity being measured with segmented m\/z ranges. Tandem mass spectra were analyzed by SEQUEST as described using the NCBI May 2002 database. The fourth dataset is that described by Tirumalai et al. (6Tirumalai R.S. Chan K.C. Prieto D.A. Issaq H.J. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Characterization of the low molecular weight human serum proteome..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1096-1103Google Scholar), focused on the lower-molecular-mass plasma proteome. Briefly standard human serum was purchased from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. High-molecular-mass proteins were removed in the presence of acetonitrile using Centriplus centrifugal filters with a molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa. The low-molecular-mass filtrate was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. The digested sample was fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography on a polysulfoethyl A column. Reversed-phase LC was subsequently performed on 300A Jupiter C-18 column coupled on line to an IT-MS (Thermo Finnegan LCQ Deca XP). Each full MS scan was followed by three MS\/MS scans where the three most abundant peptide molecular ions were selected. MS\/MS spectra were searched against the a human protein database using SEQUEST. The Blastp protein comparison algorithm (8Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool..J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar, 9Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped blast and psi-blast: A new generation of protein database search programs..Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) was used to query the sequence of each protein identified against a database containing the aggregate sequences of all proteins identified by any method. Sequences sharing greater than 95% identity over an aligned region were grouped into \u201cunique sequence clusters.\u201d Sequences were unmasked, and the minimum alignment length considered was 15 aa. This similarity-based approach was sufficient to group identical sequences, sequence fragments, and splice variants. Annotation in the nonredundant table was reported for the \u201cbest annotated\u201d protein in the cluster set. Signal peptides were predicted using the commercially available SignalP version 2.0 neural net and hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms (10Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptides and prediction of their cleavage sites..Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar) and sigmask (11Swindells M. Rae M. Pearce M. Moodie S.

Protein sequence analysis in silico: Application of structure-based bioinformatics to genomic initiatives..Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 574-580Google Scholar) protein annotation database. Each sequence received a score of +1 for a statistically significant positive signal peptide prediction from any of the three algorithms. The scores 0, 1, 2, and 3 for a particular sequence were then converted to qualitative terms \u201cno,\u201d \u201cpossible signal,\u201d \u201csignal,\u201d or \u201csignal confident,\u201d respectively. Transmembrane (TM) regions were predicted using the commercial version of TMHMM version 2.0 algorithm (13Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model: Application to complete genomes..J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Google Scholar). The total number of TM helices predicted per sequence was reported for each protein sequence. When a predicted TM region overlapped a predicted signal sequence (as it did in 40 cases in H_Plasma_NR_v2), this was interpreted as a signal sequence only. Sequences were scanned against a library of BioPendium and iPSI-BLAST (9Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Hits to these profiles were reported at a statistical e-value cut-off of 1e-5. This cut-off was chosen to maximize profile coverage and minimize the occurrence of false positives. Sequences were not masked for low complexity or coiled coils prior to profile scanning. NCBI GI number accessions for the sequences were matched to their SPTR (18Boeckmann B. Bairoch A. Apweiler R.

For graphical reporting, a series of GO terms in each category were extracted by text searching of relevant keywords (indicated by the category names on plots) through all the assigned GO definitions. A GO component summary for the whole human proteome was prepared by applying the same approach to the complete GO human database referred to above. The nonredundant (NR) plasma database was assembled as a series of tables in a PostgreSQL relational database and queried to derive summary statistics for tables and figures shown here. Four sets of accession numbers for proteins occurring in plasma (468 from Lit, 319 from 2DEMS, 607 [reported as 490 nonredundant accessions] from LCMS1, and 341 from LCMS2) were combined to yield 1,735 total initial accessions (Table I). A total of 55 of the input accessions referred to nonhuman sequences, and these were not considered further in the present analysis. A very conservative method of selecting distinct proteins was used in order to avoid counting sequence variants, splice variants, or cleavage products of one gene product as different: any sequences that shared a region larger than 15 aa with greater than 95% sequence identity were assigned to the same cluster and reported as a single entry in the nonredundant set. Fig. 1 shows one result of applying these criteria, in this case resulting in the assignment of 10 initial accessions to a single cluster for haptoglobin, a major plasma protein found in all four initial datasets and whose three separate subunit types are derived from a single translation product. This case also highlights the general observation that not all datasets used the same primary accession database (NCBI GI, Swiss-Prot, or RefSeq as examples). The largest cluster (109 \u201credundant\u201d entries) is accounted for by Igs, where all the Ig heavy and light chains of all types were clustered together as one entry arbitrarily chosen as S40354 (an Ig \u03ba chain sequence). Thus 6.2% of the input accessions were Igs, despite the fact that each of the experimental methods included steps to remove these molecules.Table IProtein redundancy within and between datasetsLitLCMS1LCMS22DEMSTotalBeginning accessions4686073413191735Minus nonhuman4585803303121680Minus intrasource redundancy and nonhuman accessions4334753182831509Unique to source in NR284334221141980Total combined NR list\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20131175 Open table in a new tab This approach is more conservative (fewer distinct proteins reported) than the methods used in some of the input data sources, which accounts for the decrease in each set when intra-set redundancy is removed (1,509 human accessions remain). When inter-set redundancies are removed (making the full list nonredundant by the criteria described above), a total of 1,175 distinct proteins remain. The entire nonredundant set, here abbreviated H_Plasma_NR_v2 (H_Plasma_NR_v1 being Table I of Ref. 1Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. The human plasma proteome: History, character, and diagnostic prospects..Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 845-867Google Scholar), is provided as a supplemental data table. Of these, a total of 980 occur in only one source. Because so many entries occur only once, and given the non-zero frequency of false MS identifications, independent confirmation will be required to validate most of this list as true plasma components. Of the 1,175 nonredundant human proteins in H_Plasma_NR_v2, 195 entries, or 17%, were present in more than one dataset (set H_Plasma_195: Fig. 2 and Table II). Only 46 (4%) were found in all four sets of accessions (Total_sources = 4, shown in bold type in Table II). Of these only one (inter-\u03b1 trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1) is predicted to have even a single transmembrane domain, and only one (the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain presumably released from red cell lysis) is predicted not to have a signal sequence. These characteristics (presence of signal sequence and absence of transmembrane domains) are those expected for major plasma proteins secreted by organs such as the liver.Table IIPlasma proteins detected in at least two datasetsAccessionLit2DEMSLCMS1LCMS2Total_accessionsTotal_sourcesSignalTMDescriptionP10809101133No060-kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrial precursor (Hsp60) (60-kDa chaperonin) (CPN60) (Heat shock protein 60) (HSP-60) (mitochondrial matrix protein P1) (P60 lymphocyte protein) (hucha60)AAB27045001122Possible signal070-kDa peroxisomal membrance protein homolog (internal fragment)P02570240283No0Actin, cytoplasmic 1 (\u03b2-actin)Q15848110022Signal confident0Adiponectin precursor (30-kDa adipocyte complement-related protein) (ACRP30) (adipose most abundant gene transcript 1) (apm-1) (gelatin-binding protein)NP_001124011022Signal confident0Afamin precursor;

    "text":"Frustrated Lewis Pairs: From Concept to Catalysis. ConspectusFrustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry has emerged in the past decade as a strategy that enables main-group compounds to activate small molecules. This concept is based on the notion that combinations of Lewis acids and bases that are sterically prevented from forming classical Lewis acid\u2013base adducts have Lewis acidity and basicity available for interaction with a third molecule. This concept has been applied to stoichiometric reactivity and then extended to catalysis. This Account describes three examples of such developments: hydrogenation, hydroamination, and CO2 reduction.The most dramatic finding from FLP chemistry was the discovery that FLPs can activate H2, thus countering the long-existing dogma that metals are required for such activation. This finding of stoichiometric reactivity was subsequently evolved to employ simple main-group species as catalysts in hydrogenations. While the initial studies focused on imines, subsequent studies uncovered FLP catalysts for a variety of organic substrates, including enamines, silyl enol ethers, olefins, and alkynes. Moreover, FLP reductions of aromatic anilines and N-heterocycles have been developed, while very recent extensions have uncovered the utility of FLP catalysts for ketone reductions.FLPs have also been shown to undergo stoichiometric reactivity with terminal alkynes. Typically, either deprotonation or FLP addition reaction products are observed, depending largely on the basicity of the Lewis base. While a variety of acid\/base combinations have been exploited to afford a variety of zwitterionic products, this reactivity can also be extended to catalysis. When secondary aryl amines are employed, hydroamination of alkynes can be performed catalytically, providing a facile, metal-free route to enamines.In a similar fashion, initial studies of FLPs with CO2 demonstrated their ability to capture this greenhouse gas. Again, modification of the constituents of the FLP led to the discovery of reaction systems that demonstrated stoichiometric reduction of CO2 to either methanol or CO. Further modification led to the development of catalytic systems for the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilylation and hydroboration or deoxygenation.As each of these areas of FLP chemistry has advanced from the observation of unusual stoichiometric reactions to catalytic processes, it is clear that the concept of FLPs provides a new strategy for the design and application of main-group chemistry and the development of new metal-free catalytic processes.",

Objective: To compare the effects of comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation with those of education alone on physiologic and psychosocial outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: University medical center. Patients: 119 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that was stable while patients received a standard medical regimen. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to either an 8-week comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program or to an 8-week education program. Pulmonary rehabilitation consisted of twelve 4-hour sessions that included education, physical and respiratory care instruction, psychosocial support, and supervised exercise training. Monthly reinforcement sessions were held for 1 year. The education group attended four 2-hour sessions that included videotapes, lectures, and discussions but not individual instruction or exercise training. Measurements: Pulmonary function, maximum exercise tolerance and endurance, gas exchange, symptoms of perceived breathlessness and muscle fatigue with exercise, shortness of breath, self-efficacy for walking, depression, general quality of well-being, and hospitalizations associated with pulmonary diseases. Patients were followed for 6 years. Results: Compared with education alone, comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation produced a significantly greater increase in maximal exercise tolerance (+1.5 metabolic equivalents [METS] compared with +0.6 METS (P < 0.001); maximal oxygen uptake, +0.11 L\/min compared with +0.03 L\/min [P = 0.06]), exercise endurance (+10.5 minutes compared with +1.3 minutes [P < 0.001]), symptoms of perceived breathlessness (score of \u22121.5 compared with +0.2 [P < 0.001]) and muscle fatigue (score of \u22121.4 compared with \u22120.2[P < 0.01]), shortness of breath (score of \u22127.0 compared with +0.6 [P <0.01]), and self-efficacy for walking (score of +1.4 compared with +0.1 [P < 0.05]). There were slight but nonsignificant differences in survival (67% compared with 56% [P = 0.32]) and duration of hospital stay ( \u22122.4 days\/patient per year compared with +1.3 days\/patient per year [P = 0.20]). Measures of lung function, depression, and general quality of life did not differ between groups. Differences tended to diminish after 1 year of follow-up. Conclusions: Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation significantly improved exercise performance and symptoms for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Benefits were partially maintained for at least 1 year and tended to diminish after that time.",

Within the wr-orbital axis vector theory, the total rehybridization required for closure of the fullerenes is approximately conserved. This result allows the development of a structure-based index of strain in the fullerenes, and it is estimated that about 80 percent of the heat of formation of the carbon atoms in C60 may be attributed to a combination of v strain and steric inhibition of resonance. Application of this analysis to the geometries of structurally characterized organometallic derivatives of C60 and C70 shows that the reactivity exhibited by the fullerenes may be attributed to the relief of a combination of local and global strain energy. C60 is of ambiguous aromatic character with anomalous magnetic properties but with the reactivity of a continuous aromatic molecule, moderated only by the tremendous strain inherent in the spheroidal structure.",

    "text":"Nanoscale Gas Flow in Shale Gas Sediments. Abstract Production of gas out of low permeability shale packages is very recent in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The process of gas release and production from shale gas sediments is not well understood. Because of adsorptive capacity of certain shale constituents, including organic carbon content, coalbed methane models are sometimes being applied to model and simulate tight shale gas production behaviour. Alternatively, conventional Darcy flow models are sometimes applied to tight shale gas. However, neither of these approaches takes into account the differences in transport mechanisms in shale due to additional nanopore networks. Hence, the application of existing models for shale results in erroneous evaluation and predictions. Our analysis shows that a combination of a nanopore network connected to a micrometre pore network controls the gas flow in shale. Mathematical modelling of gas flow in nanopores is difficult since the standard assumption of no-slip boundary conditions in the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down at the nanometre scale, while the computational times of applicable molecular-dynamics (MD) codes become exorbitant. We found that the gas flow in nanopores of the shale can be modeled with a diffusive transport regime with a constant diffusion coefficient and negligible viscous effects. The obtained diffusion coefficient is consistent with the Knudsen diffusivity which supports the slip boundary condition at the nanopore surfaces. This model can be used for shale gas evaluation and production optimization. Introduction Shale gas is a type of reservoir classified under the Unconventional Gas heading. These \u2018difficult to produce\u2019 reservoirs will play an increasingly important role in Canadian gas production because they are showing the potential to offset declining conventional gas production. Quite simply, shale gas is natural gas produced from shale sequences. Gas shales are predominantly lithified clays with organic material and detrital minerals present in varying amounts. Organic matter is an integral constituent of a productive shale gas reservoir. In addition, these fine-grained rocks are microporous, causing low permeabilities. While shale gas production has had a long history in the United States, dating back about 80 years, it is still at the very early stages of commercial production in Canada. Very little public data exists on shale gas production, yet industry interest is on the rise. A variety of estimates indicate that between 550 and 860 trillion cubic feet of gas-in-place could exist in potential shale gas formations in Western Canada(1,2). But shales can be difficult to evaluate using conventional laboratory techniques. Much of this has to do with resident clays that can have bound water either as part of their matrix or loosely bound in the interlayers in amounts of 75 to 80%. Another challenge can be the accurate measurement of in situ permeabilities, which are on the nanoscale. Core samples have often been subjected to coring induced or stress release fractures, resulting in greatly overstated permeability measurements. While some shales in Western Canada are, at this early stage, showing the proper geochemical and reservoir properties to support gas production, new techniques need to be developed to more accurately understand shale properties and their productive potential.",

By their very nature, such experiments tacitly encourage a reflexive view of brain function. Although such an approach has been remarkably productive, it ignores the alternative possibility that brain functions are mainly intrinsic, involving information processing for interpreting, responding to and predicting environmental demands. Here I argue that the latter view best captures the essence of brain function, a position that accords well with the allocation of the brain's energy resources. Recognizing the importance of intrinsic activity will require integrating knowledge from cognitive and systems neuroscience with cellular and molecular neuroscience where ion channels, receptors, components of signal transduction and metabolic pathways are all in a constant state of flux.",

    "text":"Free Radicals and Antioxidants in the Year 2000: A Historical Look to the Future. In the late 1950's free radicals and antioxidants were almost unheard of in the clinical and biological sciences but chemists had known about them for years in the context of radiation, polymer and combustion technology. Daniel Gilbert, Rebeca Gerschman and their colleagues related the toxic effects of elevated oxygen levels on aerobes to those of ionizing radiation, and proposed that oxygen toxicity is due to free radical formation, in a pioneering paper in 1956. Biochemistry owes much of its early expansion to the development and application of chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques, especially as applied to the study of proteins. Thus, superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes (MnSOD, CuZnSOD, FeSOD) were quickly identified. By the 1980's Molecular Biology had evolved from within biochemistry and microbiology to become a dominant new discipline, with DNA sequencing, recombinant DNA technology, cloning, and the development of PCR representing milestones in its advance. As a biological tool to explore reaction mechanisms, SOD was a unique and valuable asset. Its ability to inhibit radical reactions leading to oxidative damage in vitro often turned out to be due to its ability to prevent reduction of iron ions by superoxide. Nitric oxide (NO.) provided the next clue as to how SOD might be playing a critical biological role. Although NO. is sluggish in its reactions with most biomolecules it is astoundingly reactive with free radicals, including superoxide. Overall, this high reactivity of NO. with radicals may be beneficial in vivo, e.g. by scavenging peroxyl radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. If reactive oxygen species are intimately involved with the redox regulation of cell functions, as seems likely from current evidence, it may be easier to understand why attempts to change antioxidant balance in aging experiments have failed. The cell will adapt to maintain its redox balance. Indeed, transgenic animals over-expressing antioxidants show some abnormalities of function. There must therefore be a highly complex interrelationship between dietary, constitutive, and inducible antioxidants with the body, under genetic control. The challenge for the new century is to be able to understand these relationships, and how to manipulate them to our advantage to prevent and treat disease.",

Abstract Submerged vegetation respond to increased nutrient loading through a shift from slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae to fast-growing macroalgae, and the ultimate dominance of phytoplankton at high nutrient loadings. This shift reflects a change from nutrient to light limitation along the eutrophication gradient. Slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae are good competitors when nutrients are limiting because they have relatively low nutrient requirements, are able of efficient internal nutrient recycling, and can access the elevated nutrient pools in the sediment. Fast-growing macroalgae and phytoplankton are superior competitors when light is limiting because they are positioned closer to the water surface, and capture and use light more efficiently. The important ecosystem consequences of altered nutrient regimes derive from the shift in dominant vegetation types. Slow-growing seagrasses and large macroalgae are longevous, decompose slowly, and experience only moderate grazing losse...",

This study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CoreValve transcatheter heart valve (THV) for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in patients at extreme risk for surgery.Untreated severe aortic stenosis is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis is a potentially effective therapy.We performed a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized investigation evaluating the safety and efficacy of self-expanding TAVR in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with prohibitive risks for surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or major stroke at 12 months, which was compared with a pre-specified objective performance goal (OPG).A total of 41 sites in the United States recruited 506 patients, of whom 489 underwent attempted treatment with the CoreValve THV. The rate of all-cause mortality or major stroke at 12 months was 26.0% (upper 2-sided 95% confidence bound: 29.9%) versus 43.0% with the OPG (p < 0.0001). Individual 30-day and 12-month events included all-cause mortality (8.4% and 24.3%, respectively) and major stroke (2.3% and 4.3%, respectively). Procedural events at 30 days included life-threatening\/disabling bleeding (12.7%), major vascular complications (8.2%), and need for permanent pacemaker placement (21.6%). The frequency of moderate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation was lower 12 months after self-expanding TAVR (4.2%) than at discharge (10.7%; p = 0.004 for paired analysis).TAVR with a self-expanding bioprosthesis was safe and effective in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at prohibitive risk for surgical valve replacement.

    "text":"Competition between roots and microorganisms for nitrogen: mechanisms and ecological relevance. Demand of all living organisms on the same nutrients forms the basis for interspecific competition between plants and microorganisms in soils. This competition is especially strong in the rhizosphere. To evaluate competitive and mutualistic interactions between plants and microorganisms and to analyse ecological consequences of these interactions, we analysed 424 data pairs from 41 15N-labelling studies that investigated 15N redistribution between roots and microorganisms. Calculated Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics based on Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum uptake capacity) values from 77 studies on the uptake of nitrate, ammonia, and amino acids by roots and microorganisms clearly showed that, shortly after nitrogen (N) mobilization from soil organic matter and litter, microorganisms take up most N. Lower Km values of microorganisms suggest that they are especially efficient at low N concentrations, but can also acquire more N at higher N concentrations (Vmax) compared with roots. Because of the unidirectional flow of nutrients from soil to roots, plants are the winners for N acquisition in the long run. Therefore, despite strong competition between roots and microorganisms for N, a temporal niche differentiation reflecting their generation times leads to mutualistic relationships in the rhizosphere. This temporal niche differentiation is highly relevant ecologically because it: protects ecosystems from N losses by leaching during periods of slow or no root uptake; continuously provides roots with available N according to plant demand; and contributes to the evolutionary development of mutualistic interactions between roots and microorganisms.

    "text":"Techno-economic analysis of autotrophic microalgae for fuel production. Abstract It is well-established that microalgal-derived biofuels have the potential to make a significant contribution to the US fuel market, due to several unique characteristics inherent to algae. Namely, autotrophic microalgae are capable of achieving very high efficiencies in converting solar energy into biomass and oil relative to terrestrial oilseed crops, while at the same time exhibiting great flexibility in the quality of land and water required for algal cultivation. These characteristics allow for the possibility to produce appreciable amounts of algal biofuels relative to today\u2019s petroleum fuel market, while greatly mitigating \u201cfood-versus-fuel\u201d concerns. However, there is a wide lack of public agreement on the near-term economic viability of algal biofuels, due to uncertainties and speculation on process scale-up associated with the nascent stage of the algal biofuel industry. The present study aims to establish baseline economics for two microalgae pathways, by performing a comprehensive analysis using a set of assumptions for what can plausibly be achieved within a five-year timeframe. Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond and closed tubular photobioreactor (PBR) systems. The production scales were set at 10 million gallons per year of raw algal oil, subsequently upgraded to a \u201cgreen diesel\u201d blend stock via hydrotreating. Rigorous mass balances were performed using Aspen Plus simulation software, and associated costs were evaluated on a unit-level basis. Upon completing the base case scenarios, the cost of lipid production to achieve a 10% return was determined to be $8.52\/gal for open ponds and $18.10\/gal for PBRs. Hydrotreating to produce a diesel blend stock added onto this marginally, bringing the totals to $9.84\/gal and $20.53\/gal of diesel, for the respective cases. These costs have potential for significant improvement in the future if better microalgal strains can be identified that would be capable of sustaining high growth rates at high lipid content. Given that it is difficult to maximize both of these parameters simultaneously, it was determined that the near-term research should focus on maximizing lipid content as it offers more substantial cost reduction potential relative to an improved algae growth rate. Additional economic sensitivity studies were established to identify other important cost drivers, and a resource assessment comparison was made to evaluate parameters such as water and CO 2 requirements.",

Intensive mechanized agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon grew by >3.6 million hectares (ha) during 2001-2004. Whether this cropland expansion resulted from intensified use of land previously cleared for cattle ranching or new deforestation has not been quantified and has major implications for future deforestation dynamics, carbon fluxes, forest fragmentation, and other ecosystem services. We combine deforestation maps, field surveys, and satellite-based information on vegetation phenology to characterize the fate of large (>25-ha) clearings as cropland, cattle pasture, or regrowing forest in the years after initial clearing in Mato Grosso, the Brazilian state with the highest deforestation rate and soybean production since 2001. Statewide, direct conversion of forest to cropland totaled >540,000 ha during 2001-2004, peaking at 23% of 2003 annual deforestation. Cropland deforestation averaged twice the size of clearings for pasture (mean sizes, 333 and 143 ha, respectively), and conversion occurred rapidly; >90% of clearings for cropland were planted in the first year after deforestation. Area deforested for cropland and mean annual soybean price in the year of forest clearing were directly correlated (R(2) = 0.72), suggesting that deforestation rates could return to higher levels seen in 2003-2004 with a rebound of crop prices in international markets. Pasture remains the dominant land use after forest clearing in Mato Grosso, but the growing importance of larger and faster conversion of forest to cropland defines a new paradigm of forest loss in Amazonia and refutes the claim that agricultural intensification does not lead to new deforestation.",

The articulation of the notion of \"frustrated Lewis pairs\" (FLPs), which emerged from the discovery that H2 can be reversibly activated by combinations of sterically encumbered Lewis acids and bases, has prompted a great deal of recent activity. Perhaps the most remarkable consequence has been the development of FLP catalysts for the hydrogenation of a range of organic substrates. In the past 9 years, the substrate scope has evolved from bulky polar species to include a wide range of unsaturated organic molecules. In addition, effective stereoselective metal-free hydrogenation catalysts have begun to emerge. The mechanism of this activation of H2 has been explored, and the nature and range of Lewis acid\/base combinations capable of effecting such activation have also expanded to include a variety of non-metal species. The reactivity of FLPs with a variety of other small molecules, including olefins, alkynes, and a range of element oxides, has also been developed. Although much of this latter chemistry has uncovered unique stoichiometric transformations, metal-free catalytic hydroamination, CO2 reduction chemistry, and applications in polymerization have also been achieved. The concept is also beginning to find applications in bioinorganic and materials chemistry as well as heterogeneous catalysis. This Perspective highlights many of these developments and discusses the relationship between FLPs and established chemistry. Some of the directions and developments that are likely to emerge from FLP chemistry in the future are also presented.",

    "text":"The role of highly unsaturated fatty acids in aquatic foodweb processes. 1. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are almost exclusively synthesized by plants. Animals can convert from one form of PUFA to another through elongation and desaturation, but very few can synthesize PUFA de novo. PUFA play an important role in regulating cell membrane properties, serve as precursors for important animal hormones and are essential for animals. 2. In aquaculture studies, highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), a subset of PUFA, have been found to be critical for maintaining high growth, survival and reproductive rates and high food conversion efficiencies for a wide variety of marine and freshwater organisms. 3. The plankton literature suggests high food-quality algae species are rich in HUFA and low food-quality algae are poor in HUFA. Adding semi-pure emulsions of HUFA to algae monocultures can markedly increase the growth rates of zooplankton feeding on these mixtures. 4. A study measuring zooplankton biomass accrual when feeding on natural phytoplankton found a strong correlation between phytoplankton HUFA (specifically eicosapentaenoic acid) content and herbivorous zooplankton production. 5. The aquatic ecology literature suggests that planktonic foodwebs with high HUFA content phytoplankton have high zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios, while systems with low HUFA phytoplankton have low zooplankton biomass. Also, the seasonal succession of plankton in many temperate lakes follows patterns tied to phytoplankton HUFA content, with intense zooplankton grazing and \u2018clear-water-phases\u2019 characteristic of periods when the phytoplankton is dominated by HUFA-rich species. 6. Herbivorous zooplankton production is constrained by the zooplankton\u2019s ability to ingest and digest phytoplankton. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that much of the phytoplankton which is assimilated may be nutritionally inadequate. HUFA may be key nutritional constituents of zooplankton diets, and may determine energetic efficiency across the plant\u2013animal interface, secondary production and the strength of trophic coupling in aquatic pelagic foodwebs.",

Here we demonstrate that a porphyrin-involved metal-organic framework (MOF), PCN-222, can selectively capture and further photoreduce CO2 with high efficiency under visible-light irradiation. Mechanistic information gleaned from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (combined with time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy) has elucidated the relationship between the photocatalytic activity and the electron-hole separation efficiency. The presence of a deep electron trap state in PCN-222 effectively inhibits the detrimental, radiative electron-hole recombination. As a direct result, PCN-222 significantly enhances photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into formate anion compared to the corresponding porphyrin ligand itself.

By engaging with debates surrounding the meaning of locality and authenticity, the paper challenges existing understandings of these concepts and offers a new way forward for tourism research by arguing that \u201clocal food\u201d has the potential to enhance the visitor experience by connecting consumers to the region and its perceived culture and heritage.",

The benefits to humans of renewable fresh water include water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial uses, for production of fish and waterfowl, and for such instream uses as recreation, transportation, and waste disposal.\r\n\r\nIn the coming century, climate change and a growing imbalance among freshwater supply, consumption, and population will alter the water cycle dramatically. Many regions of the world are already limited by the amount and quality of available water. In the next 30 yr alone, accessible runoff is unlikely to increase more than 10%, but the earth's population is projected to rise by approximately one-third. Unless the efficiency of water use rises, this imbalance will reduce freshwater ecosystem services, increase the number of aquatic species facing extinction, and further fragment wetlands, rivers, deltas, and estuaries.\r\n\r\nBased on the scientific evidence currently available, we conclude that: (1) over half of accessible freshwater runoff globally is already appropriated for human use; (2) more than 1 \u00d7 109 people currently lack access to clean drinking water and almost 3 \u00d7 109 people lack basic sanitation services; (3) because the human population will grow faster than increases in the amount of accessible fresh water, per capita availability of fresh water will decrease in the coming century; (4) climate change will cause a general intensification of the earth's hydrological cycle in the next 100 yr, with generally increased precipitation, evapotranspiration, and occurrence of storms, and significant changes in biogeochemical processes influencing water quality; (5) at least 90% of total water discharge from U.S. rivers is strongly affected by channel fragmentation from dams, reservoirs, interbasin diversions, and irrigation; and (6) globally, 20% of freshwater fish species are threatened or extinct, and freshwater species make up 47% of all animals federally endangered in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe growing demands on freshwater resources create an urgent need to link research with improved water management. Better monitoring, assessment, and forecasting of water resources will help to allocate water more efficiently among competing needs. Currently in the United States, at least six federal departments and 20 agencies share responsibilities for various aspects of the hydrologic cycle.

A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological\u2013economic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socio-economic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO\/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socio-economic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5\u2032\u00d75\u2032 latitude\/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socio-economic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socio-economic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change.",

Total N loss due to denitrification generally increased as soil texture became finer and WFPS increased. The only exception to this was the C-amended sand, where N losses up to 26 and 66% were recorded at 60 and 75% WFPS, respectively. Denitrification rates at high N concentrations were quite small in the absence of an available C source but increased with increasing available C (glucose). The N\u2082\/N\u2082O ratio generally increased with time of incubation after the initial treatment application. The largest ratios (up to 549) were found at the highest available C rate and generally at the highest soil water content. The presence of high NO\u2083 concentrations apparently inhibited the conversion of N\u2082O to N\u2082, resulting in lower N\u2082\/N\u2082O ratios. Using an average N\u2082\/N\u2082O ratio for estimation of denitrification from N\u2082O field measurements cannot be recommended because of the variation in this ratio due to the many environmental factors altered by field management that influence denitrification and the relative production of N\u2082 and N\u2082O.

Bees provide essential pollination services that are potentially affected both by local farm management and the surrounding landscape. To better understand these different factors, we modelled the relative effects of landscape composition (nesting and floral resources within foraging distances), landscape configuration (patch shape, interpatch connectivity and habitat aggregation) and farm management (organic vs. conventional and local-scale field diversity), and their interactions, on wild bee abundance and richness for 39 crop systems globally. Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture.",

Extreme fast charging, with a goal of 15 minutes recharge time, is poised to accelerate mass market adoption of electric vehicles, curb greenhouse gas emissions and, in turn, provide nations with greater energy security.

The present-day high-energy lithium-ion batteries with graphite anodes and transition metal oxide cathodes in liquid electrolytes are unable to achieve the fast-charging goal without negatively affecting electrochemical performance and safety. Here we discuss the challenges and future research directions towards fast charging at the level of battery materials from mass transport, charge transfer and thermal management perspectives. Moreover, we highlight advanced characterization techniques to fundamentally understand the failure mechanisms of batteries during fast charging, which in turn would inform more rational battery designs. Along with high energy density, fast-charging ability would enable battery-powered electric vehicles.

Persistent microvascular hyperpermeability to plasma proteins even after the cessation of injury is a characteristic but poorly understood feature of normal wound healing. It results in extravasation of fibrinogen that clots to form fibrin, which serves as a provisional matrix and promotes angiogenesis and scar formation. We present evidence indicating that vascular permeability factor (VPF; also known as vascular endothelial growth factor) may be responsible for the hyperpermeable state, as well as the angiogenesis, that are characteristic of healing wounds. Hyperpermeable blood vessels were identified in healing split-thickness guinea pig and rat punch biopsy skin wounds by their capacity to extravasate circulating macromolecular tracers (colloidal carbon, fluoresceinated dextran). Vascular permeability was maximal at 2-3 d, but persisted as late as 7 d after wounding. Leaky vessels were found initially at the wound edges and later in the subepidermal granulation tissue as keratinocytes migrated to cover the denuded wound surface. Angiogenesis was also prominent within this 7-d interval. In situ hybridization revealed that greatly increased amounts of VPF mRNA were expressed by keratinocytes, initially those at the wound edge, and, at later intervals, keratinocytes that migrated to cover the wound surface; occasional mononuclear cells also expressed VPF mRNA. Secreted VPF was detected by immunofluoroassay of medium from cultured human keratinocytes. These data identify keratinocytes as an important source of VPF gene transcript and protein, correlate VPF expression with persistent vascular hyperpermeability and angiogenesis, and suggest that VPF is an important cytokine in wound healing.",

Human activities have clearly caused dramatic alterations of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, and analyses of the extent and effects of such changes are now common in the scientific literature. However, any attempt to evaluate N cycling processes within ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic influences on the N cycle, requires an understanding of the magnitude of inputs via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Although there have been many studies addressing the microbiology, physiology, and magnitude of N fixation at local scales, there are very few estimates of BNF over large scales. We utilized >100 preexisting published estimates of BNF to generate biome- and global-level estimates of biological N fixation. We also used net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from the Century terrestrial ecosystem model to examine global relationships between these variables and BNF as well as to compare observed and Century-modeled BNF. Our data-based estimates showed a strong positive relationship between ecosystem ET and BNF, and our analyses suggest that while the model's simple relationships for BNF predict broad scale patterns, they do not capture much of the variability or magnitude of published rates. Patterns of BNF were also similar to patterns of ecosystem NPP. Our \u201cbest estimate\u201d of potential nitrogen fixation by natural ecosystems is \u223c195 Tg N yr\u22121, with a range of 100\u2013290 Tg N yr\u22121. Although these estimates do not account for the decrease in natural N fixation due to cultivation, this would not dramatically alter our estimate, as the greatest reductions in area have occurred in systems characterized by relatively low rates of N fixation (e.g., grasslands). Although our estimate of BNF in natural ecosystems is similar to previously published estimates of terrestrial BNF, we believe that this study provides a more documented, constrained estimate of this important flux.",

Our goal is to provide first-order results from various CO2 pathways, allowing correspondence with studies of marine biological effects of added CO2. Parts of the Southern Ocean become undersaturated with respect to aragonite under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1, A2, B1, and B2 emission pathways and the WRE pathways that stabilize CO2 at 650 ppm or above. Cumulative atmospheric emission of 5000 Pg C produces aragonite undersaturation in most of the surface ocean; 10,000 Pg C also produces calcite undersaturation in most of the surface ocean. Stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm produces both calcite and aragonite undersaturation in most of the deep ocean. The simulated SRES pathways produce global surface pH reductions of \u223c0.3\u20130.5 units by year 2100. Approximately this same reduction is produced by WRE650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios and by the 1250 Pg C emission scenario by year 2300. Atmospheric emissions of 5000 Pg C and 20,000 Pg C produce global surface pH reductions of 0.8 and 1.4 units, respectively, by year 2300. Simulations of deep ocean CO2 injection as an alternative to atmospheric release show greater chemical impact on the deep ocean as the price for having less impact on the surface ocean and climate. Changes in ocean chemistry of the magnitude shown are likely to be biologically significant.",

The concept of land use transition highlights that land use change is non-linear and is associated with other societal and biophysical system changes. A transition in land use is not a fixed pattern, nor is it deterministic. Land use transitions can be caused by negative socio-ecological feedbacks that arise from a depletion of key resources or from socio-economic change and innovation that take place rather independently from the ecological system. Here, we explore whether the sources of land use transitions are mostly endogenous socio-ecological forces or exogenous socio-economic factors. We first review a few generic pathways of forest transition as identified in national case studies, and evaluate the varying ecological quality of expanding forests associated with these pathways. We then discuss possible explanatory frameworks of land use transitions. We use the case of the recent forest transition in Vietnam as an illustration. Socio-ecological feedbacks seem to better explain a slowing down of deforestation and stabilization of forest cover, while exogenous socio-economic factors better account for reforestation. We conclude by discussing the prospects of accelerating land use transitions in tropical forest countries.",

Abstract Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are webs of DNA covered with antimicrobial molecules that constitute a newly described killing mechanism in innate immune defense. Previous publications reported that NETs take up to 3\u20134 h to form via an oxidant-dependent event that requires lytic death of neutrophils. In this study, we describe neutrophils responding uniquely to Staphylococcus aureus via a novel process of NET formation that did not require neutrophil lysis or even breach of the plasma membrane. The multilobular nucleus rapidly became rounded and condensed. During this process, we observed the separation of the inner and outer nuclear membranes and budding of vesicles, and the separated membranes and vesicles were filled with nuclear DNA. The vesicles were extruded intact into the extracellular space where they ruptured, and the chromatin was released. This entire process occurred via a unique, very rapid (5\u201360 min), oxidant-independent mechanism. Mitochondrial DNA constituted very little if any of these NETs. They did have a limited amount of proteolytic activity and were able to kill S. aureus. With time, the nuclear envelope ruptured, and DNA filled the cytoplasm presumably for later lytic NET production, but this was distinct from the vesicular release mechanism. Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin, autolysin, and a lipase were identified in supernatants with NET-inducing activity, but Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin was the dominant NET inducer. We describe a new mechanism of NET release that is very rapid and contributes to trapping and killing of S. aureus.",

In the past decade, the literature on transitions toward sustainable socio-technical systems has made a considerable contribution in understanding the complex and multi-dimensional shifts considered necessary to adapt societies and economies to sustainable modes of production and consumption. However, transition analyses have often neglected where transitions take place, and the spatial configurations and dynamics of the networks within which transitions evolve. A more explicit spatial perspective on sustainability transitions contributes to the extant transitions literature in three ways. Firstly it provides a contextualization on the limited territorial sensitivity of existing literature. Secondly, it explicitly acknowledges and investigates diversity in transition processes, which follows from a \u2018natural\u2019 variety in institutional conditions, networks, actor strategies and resources across space. Thirdly, it encompasses not only greater emphasis but also an opportunity to connect to a body of literature geared to understanding the international, trans-local nature of transition dynamics. Concerned with the prevalent lack of attention for the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions in most studies, this paper seeks to unpick and make explicit sustainability transition geographies from the vantage point of economic geography. The paper argues that there are two interrelated problems requiring attention: the institutional embeddedness of socio-technical development processes within specific territorial spaces, and an explicit multi-scalar conception of socio-technical trajectories. Following these arguments, the paper concludes that transitions research would do well to take a closer look at the geographical unevenness of transition processes from the perspective of global networks and local nodes.",

Using such a fit implies that all the information necessary for prediction is contained in the carbon flux itself, so that the organic-carbon flux FOC(z) at any depth z can be predicted from the flux of organic carbon FOC(z0) at some near-surface depth z0. Here, we challenge this basic premise, arguing that fluxes of ballast minerals (silicate and carbonate biominerals, and dust) determine deep-water POC fluxes, so that a mechanism-based model of POC flux must simultaneously predict fluxes of both POC and ballast minerals. This assertion is based on the empirical observation that POC fluxes are tightly linked quantitatively to fluxes of ballast minerals in the deep ocean. Here, we develop a model structure that incorporates this observation, and fit this model to US JGOFS EqPac data. This model structure, plus the preliminary parameter estimates we have obtained, can be used to explore the implications of our model in studies of the ocean carbon cycle.",

    "text":"Climate change mitigation: A spatial analysis of global land suitability for clean development mechanism afforestation and reforestation. Within the Kyoto Protocol, the clean development mechanism (CDM) is an instrument intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development, with the multiple goals of poverty reduction, environmental benefits and cost-effective emission reductions. The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon \u2018sink\u2019 projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland\/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods.",

    "text":"Homologous recombination in DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance. Homologous recombination (HR) comprises a series of interrelated pathways that function in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). In addition, recombination provides critical support for DNA replication in the recovery of stalled or broken replication forks, contributing to tolerance of DNA damage. A central core of proteins, most critically the RecA homolog Rad51, catalyzes the key reactions that typify HR: homology search and DNA strand invasion. The diverse functions of recombination are reflected in the need for context-specific factors that perform supplemental functions in conjunction with the core proteins. The inability to properly repair complex DNA damage and resolve DNA replication stress leads to genomic instability and contributes to cancer etiology. Mutations in the BRCA2 recombination gene cause predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer as well as Fanconi anemia, a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a defect in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. The cellular functions of recombination are also germane to DNA-based treatment modalities of cancer, which target replicating cells by the direct or indirect induction of DNA lesions that are substrates for recombination pathways. This review focuses on mechanistic aspects of HR relating to DSB and ICL repair as well as replication fork support.",

A normal mode analysis of 20 proteins in 'open' or 'closed' forms was performed using simple potential and protein models. The quality of the results was found to depend upon the form of the protein studied, normal modes obtained with the open form of a given protein comparing better with the conformational change than those obtained with the closed form. Moreover, when the motion of the protein is a highly collective one, then, in all cases considered, there is a single low-frequency normal mode whose direction compares well with the conformational change. When it is not, in most cases there is still a single low-frequency normal mode giving a good description of the pattern of the atomic displacements, as they are observed experimentally during the conformational change. Hence a lot of information on the nature of the conformational change of a protein is often found in a single low-frequency normal mode of its open form. Since this information can be obtained through the normal mode analysis of a model as simple as that used in the present study, it is likely that the property captured by such an analysis is for the most part a property of the shape of the protein itself. One of the points that has to be clarified now is whether or not amino acid sequences have been selected in order to allow proteins to follow a single normal mode direction, as least at the very beginning of their conformational change.",

    "text":"Biomass burning emissions estimated with a global fire assimilation system based on observed fire radiative power. Abstract. The Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.0) calculates biomass burning emissions by assimilating Fire Radiative Power (FRP) observations from the MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. It corrects for gaps in the observations, which are mostly due to cloud cover, and filters spurious FRP observations of volcanoes, gas flares and other industrial activity. The combustion rate is subsequently calculated with land cover-specific conversion factors. Emission factors for 40 gas-phase and aerosol trace species have been compiled from a literature survey. The corresponding daily emissions have been calculated on a global 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 grid from 2003 to the present. General consistency with the Global Fire Emission Database version 3.1 (GFED3.1) within its accuracy is achieved while maintaining the advantages of an FRP-based approach: GFASv1.0 makes use of the quantitative information on the combustion rate that is contained in the FRP observations, and it detects fires in real time at high spatial and temporal resolution. GFASv1.0 indicates omission errors in GFED3.1 due to undetected small fires. It also exhibits slightly longer fire seasons in South America and North Africa and a slightly shorter fire season in Southeast Asia. GFASv1.0 has already been used for atmospheric reactive gas simulations in an independent study, which found good agreement with atmospheric observations. We have performed simulations of the atmospheric aerosol distribution with and without the assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD). They indicate that the emissions of particulate matter need to be boosted by a factor of 2\u20134 to reproduce the global distribution of organic matter and black carbon. This discrepancy is also evident in the comparison of previously published top-down and bottom-up estimates. For the time being, a global enhancement of the particulate matter emissions by 3.4 is recommended. Validation with independent AOD and PM10 observations recorded during the Russian fires in summer 2010 show that the global Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Change (MACC) aerosol model with GFASv1.0 aerosol emissions captures the smoke plume evolution well when organic matter and black carbon are enhanced by the recommended factor. In conjunction with the assimilation of MODIS AOD, the use of GFASv1.0 with enhanced emission factors quantitatively improves the forecast of the aerosol load near the surface sufficiently to allow air quality warnings with a lead time of up to four days.",

Industrial reactors for algal culture are open ponds, photobioreactors and closed systems. Algae are very important as a biomass source. Algae will some day be competitive as a source for biofuel. Different species of algae may be better suited for different types of fuel. Algae can be grown almost anywhere, even on sewage or salt water, and does not require fertile land or food crops, and processing requires less energy than the algae provides. Algae can be a replacement for oil based fuels, one that is more effective and has no disadvantages. Algae are among the fastest-growing plants in the world, and about 50% of their weight is oil. This lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes. Microalgae have much faster growth-rates than terrestrial crops. the per unit area yield of oil from algae is estimated to be from 20,000 to 80,000\u00a0l per acre, per year; this is 7\u201331 times greater than the next best crop, palm oil.

The cellular organization of the mammalian brain is more complicated than that of any other known biological tissue. As a result, much of the nervous system\u2019s fine cellular structure is unexplored. While it has been known for more than a century that a directional network interconnects many kinds of nerve cells (Cajal, 1899Cajal R.S. Textura del sistema nervioso del hombre y de los vertebrados. Moya, Madrid1899Google Scholar), and that this network underlies behaviors (Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. Yale University Press, Yale1906Google Scholar), for the most part, the precise relationships between the brain\u2019s many cellular components are not known. Several laboratories are now beginning to generate such data in mammals using electron microscopy (EM). This work has provided new insights into the visual system (Anderson et al., 2011Anderson J.R.

Descriptions of neuronal network structure could also be important if derangements in networks underlie psychiatric or developmental disorders and\/or if modifications to these networks store learned information (i.e., memories). Exploring such possibilities may require methods for obtaining detailed synaptic-level connectomic data. A reconstruction effort on the scale of mammalian brains, however, would be enormously expensive and difficult to justify without assurances that this kind of information would be of value (Marblestone et al., 2013Marblestone, A., Daugharthy, E., Kalhor, R., Peikon, I., Kebschull, J., Shipman, S., Mishchenko, Y., Dalrymple, D., Zamft, B., Kording, K., Boyden, E., Zador, A., and Church, G.

Substantial savings in effort could come if the connectivity of the cerebral cortex could be ascertained without looking at every single synapse. For example, if the overlap of axons and dendrites at light microscope resolution provides sufficient information to infer connectivity (Hill et al., 2012Hill S.L. Wang Y. Riachi I. Sch\u00fcrmann F. Markram H. Statistical connectivity provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2885-E2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), huge data sets of EM images of cerebral cortex might be superfluous. We thus decided to reconstruct all the connectivity within a very small piece of neocortical tissue (1,500 \u03bcm3 at a resolution allowing identification of every synaptic vesicle) to be in a better position to decide whether or not obtaining complete brain maps at such a fine level of resolution reveals interesting properties that cannot be inferred from either lower resolution or more sparse analyses. Previous connectomic studies of retina and hippocampus concluded that connectivity was not entirely predictable from the proximity of presynaptic elements to postsynaptic targets (Briggman et al., 2011Briggman K.L. Helmstaedter M. Denk W. Wiring specificity in the direction-selectivity circuit of the retina.Nature. 2011; 471: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, Mishchenko et al., 2010Mishchenko Y. Hu T. Spacek J.

Connectomic reconstruction of the inner plexiform layer in the mouse retina.Nature. 2013; 500: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We wished to examine this question again but now in neocortex for several reasons. First, a large effort is underway to model and simulate neocortical processing based on stochastic connectivity based on spatial overlap of axons and dendrites (Markram et al., 2012Markram, H., Ailamaki A., Alvandpour A., Amunts K., Andreoni W., Ashburner J., Axer M., Baaden M., Badia R., Bartolome J., et al. (2012). The human brain project: A report to the European Commission. https:\/\/www.humanbrainproject.eu\/documents\/10180\/17648\/TheHBPReport_LR.pdf\/18e5747e-10af-4bec-9806-d03aead57655.Google Scholar). Second, the retina and the hippocampus (archicortex) are phylogenetically older than neocortex and may have evolved deterministic targeting mechanisms that could explain why overlap is insufficient to predict connectivity in those regions. In neocortex, however, less is known and it remains possible that spatial overlap is sufficient to explain synaptic connections between particular pairs of axons and dendrites. Third, in analyzing our data, we have found significant redundancies in the synaptic connections and wanted to know if these were accidental. For all these reasons, we have attempted to analyze the connectivity of each of many axons and dendrites by looking at not only the synapses each axon establishes but also the occurrences when axons and dendrites get close with potential postsynaptic targets but do not establish synapses. Even for such a small volume, however, we found considerable technical challenges standing in the way of doing such an analysis. After \u201csaturating\u201d the segmentation of a sub-region in the middle of the imaged volume in which all intracellular space was assigned to one or another cellular entity, we then needed to catalog all the connectivity and structural information into a minable database before analyses. Surprisingly, analysis of the connectomic data turned out to be even more challenging than creating the image data or annotating it. This \u201comics\u201d approach provided a wealth of data for potential analysis. Here, we investigate aspects of the connectivity of excitatory axons and find interesting patterns that would have been difficult to detect with lower resolution methods. To assist readers who wish to examine the data in detail, we serve out the images and their segmentations and annotated databases that link to the image data, as well as all the software we developed for the display and analysis (described herein http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/). The results are divided into two parts. We first describe the technical approaches for acquiring and analyzing this data and then turn to some of the biological findings. We built an automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) that retrieves brain sections from the water boat of a diamond knife immediately as they are cut via a continuous submerged conveyor belt (Figure 1A ; Movie S1). The tape\u2019s pulling motion and its adhesiveness cause the caught sections to lie flat on the tape\u2019s surface (Figure 1A, inset). To generate the cerebral cortex image dataset in this paper, we collected 2,250 29-nm coronal brain slices (each section \u223c1 mm2, total volume 0.13 mm3) from somatosensory cortex of a young adult mouse on \u223c6.5 m of Kapton tape (Figure 1B). We generated 1,000 sections per 24 hr. We chose 29 nm as section thickness in order to trace the finest neuronal wires (Mishchenko, 2009Mishchenko Y. Automation of 3D reconstruction of neural tissue from large volume of conventional serial section transmission electron micrographs.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 176: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and with a sharp knife we have successfully sectioned >10,000 sections from a small block without missing a cut and importantly manual segmentation is nearly flawless at this thickness (see below). Following section collection, the tape was cut into strips and placed on silicon wafers that were then photographed (Figure 1C). The wafer image was used to map the positions of the sections on the wafer for automated EM (Hayworth et al., 2014Hayworth K.J. Morgan J.L. Schalek R. Berger D.R. Hildebrand D.G. Lichtman J.W.

The sections used for all of the subsequent analysis in this paper are \u223c2.5 mm2. See also Figure S1 and Movies S2, S3, S4, and S5. Sections were imaged with a scanning electron microscope using backscattered electron detection (9\u201310 keV incident electron energy), which had sufficient resolution and contrast to detect individual synaptic vesicles (red arrows, Figure 2A). In this study, reduced osmium tetroxide-thiocarbohydrazide (TCH)-osmium (ROTO) was used as stain (Friedman and Ellisman, 1981Friedman P.L. Ellisman M.H. Enhanced visualization of peripheral nerve and sensory receptors in the scanning electron microscope using cryofracture and osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium impregnation.J.

High-contrast en bloc staining of neuronal tissue for field emission scanning electron microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The ROTO stain highlights a tubular organelle coursing through most unmyelinated axons, aiding in reconstruction of fine processes (blue arrows, Figure 2A) (Sinha et al., 2013Sinha, A., Roncal, W.G., Kasthuri, N., Lichtman, J.W., Burns, R., and Kazhdan, M. (2013). Automatic annotation of axoplasmic reticula in pursuit of connectomes using high resolution neural EM data. 3rd Annual Hopkins Imaging Conference.Google Scholar; Movies S4 and S5). The plasma membranes with this staining protocol were 6\u20138 nm in width. We acquired high-resolution images with 3-nm pixels, ensuring that membrane boundaries would be oversampled for easier reconstruction. The same sample was imaged at lower resolutions (30 or 2,000 nm) to rapidly acquire images of larger tissue volumes (Figure 2B). Image acquisition scan rate was 1 M pixels per s. Time is also spent moving the stage from one section to another and automatic focusing each successive section, roughly halving the overall throughput. Speed-up can be achieved in several ways, including imaging different wafers in parallel on multiple microscopes, use of secondary electron detection (with 1.5\u20133 keV incident electron energy and speeds of up to 40 M pixels per s; Figure S1A), and by imaging in a new microscope that parallelizes imaging by use of multiple scanning beams (Eberle et al., 2015Eberle A.L. Mikula S. Schalek R. Lichtman J.W. Tate M.L. Zeidler D. High-resolution, high-throughput imaging with a multibeam scanning electron microscope.J. Microsc. 2015; (Published online January 27, 2015)https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/jmi.12224Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; Figure S1B). We created a multi-scale digital volume in order to provide tissue context surrounding the region in which we did circuit reconstruction. We first imaged all the sections in their entirety at low resolution (2 \u03bcm\/pixel). We also imaged a sub-volume (a radial strip of cerebral cortex extending from the pia to white matter, 500 \u03bcm wide and 1 mm long) at 29 nm\/pixel and finally we imaged an \u223c80,000 \u03bcm3 box (40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 50 \u03bcm3) that transected the apical dendritic bundle of a cortical mini-column (Krieger et al., 2007Krieger P. Kuner T. Sakmann B. Synaptic connections between layer 5B pyramidal neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex are independent of apical dendrite bundling.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11473-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at high resolution (3 nm\/pixel) (Figure 2B; Movies S4 and S5). A manual tool to segment neuronal processes in the image data: we developed a computer-assisted manual space-filling segmentation and annotation program (\u201cVAST,\u201d http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/Code\/VAST\/). VAST allowed us to work with EM images online, avoiding the need for their local storage, to \u201ccolor\u201d the images in at multiple scales of resolution, to organize the results in a flexible annotation framework, to export results for 3D visualization and analysis, and to do these tasks without being limited by working memory. We tested the accuracy of this manual tracing approach, by analyzing saturated segmentations in which every membrane-bound object in every section was colored in. We used a Matlab script (http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/Code\/findOrphans) to find \u201corphans\u201d (i.e., segmented objects that were not connected to parent axons and dendrites; see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). The analysis found that in a \u223c500 \u03bcm3 cylinder surrounding an apical dendrite (see below), there were no axonal or dendritic orphans in the volume, which included a total of 568 spines and 601 terminal axon branches. With the VAST manual reconstructions, miswiring errors (e.g., connecting the spine head or terminal axon varicosity to the wrong parent process) were also apparently rare because there was substantial agreement between two experienced tracers working independently in the assignment of the finest processes to their parent dendrites or axons (spine necks >99%; 565\/568 agreement and axonal terminal branches >99%; 598\/601 agreement). In the six cases of disagreement, the two tracers reached consensus once they compared results, meaning there were no places in which the axonal and dendritic data were actually ambiguous. However, for the astrocytic cytoplasm (Figure 3J), there were many glial fragments for which experts could not agree on how they were connected. Suite of automatic tracing tools: based on the tracing, we found 6.4 profiles per \u03bcm2 in a section and estimated that in the 64,000 um3 high-resolution volume there are 13.7 million cell profiles in its 1,850 sections. Experienced tracers require about 15 min to trace the \u223c200 cell profiles in 1 \u03bcm3 so about two people-years of 24\/7 tracing would be required to segment out all the profiles in this volume. We therefore developed ways to generate more rapid and automated segmentation of neural processes (details and software are available at http:\/\/www.rhoana.org\/). To aid this effort, we manually traced all of the cellular objects in several small volumes (\u223c150 \u03bcm3) and used this \u201cstained glass\u201d segmented image data (Figure 3B) to train automated reconstruction methods (Fusion: Vazquez-Reina et al., 2011Vazquez-Reina, A., Gelbart, M., Huang, D., Lichtman, J., Miller, E.L., Pfister, H.

Neuroinform. 2014; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on this training, we produced automated segmentations of all the cellular processes within a high-resolution volume with dimensions of 30.7 \u00d7 30.7 \u00d7 33.7 \u03bcm (via the RhoANA pipeline using random forest membrane probabilities and graph-cut segmentations with the Fusion segmentation algorithm). In a sub-volume of the cube centered on the \u201cred\u201d neuron\u02bcs apical dendrite (see below), we produced a different segmentation (via RhoANA using the Maxout deep-learning convolutional neural network for membrane probabilities and the GALA segment agglomeration algorithm). These automatically segmented volumes are available at http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/data\/automatic_segmentation (Figure 3C; Movie S7). We found that although fully automated methods are improving rapidly, they are still only first passes and require human assistance to correct merge and split errors. In single images, we found that 92.6% of the pixels or 87.6% (of 92,747) of the profiles were correctly segmented with a fully automated segmentation algorithm (RhoANA with Maxout and GALA; Figures S2A and S2B). However, despite the appearance of largely correct two-dimensional data, when we analyzed cellular profiles in three dimensions, we estimated the need for \u223c0.9 split operations (to correct inappropriate mergers) and 5.8 merge operations (to correct splits) per \u03bcm3 (Figure S2C; Movie S8). We did these corrections for a sub-volume of the full segmented dataset (cylinder 3; see below), with a newly developed tool for computer-assisted editing and rendering (Mojo and an online version for this tool \u201cDojo\u201d; Haehn et al., 2014Haehn, D., Knowles-Barley, S., Roberts, M., Beyer, J., Kasthuri, N., Lichtman, J.W., and Pfister, H. (2014). Design and evaluation of interactive proofreading tools for connectomics. Proceedings of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.Google Scholar; available at http:\/\/www.rhoana.org\/). The most important metric for automated reconstruction is the accuracy of the resulting connectivity matrix, but we concluded that at present it is premature to generate fully automated connectivity matrices. In the medium resolution volume, we identified neuronal somata in order to locate the cortical layer boundaries (Figure 3A) and reconstructed the shapes of a subset of cells running in a cortical mini-column (Figure 3A; Movie S6). Most (\u223c70%, 21\/30) of these cells were pyramidal and the rest fell into several different categories, including putative interneurons, atypical excitatory cells, and glial cells. We then fully annotated a sub-volume of somatosensory cortex within this same volume (Movie S9; http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/data\/segments). Building on work done previously in the hippocampus (Mishchenko et al., 2010Mishchenko Y. Hu T. Spacek J. Mendenhall J. Harris K.M. Chklovskii D.B. Ultrastructural analysis of hippocampal neuropil from the connectomics perspective.Neuron. 2010; 67: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, Stepanyants and Chklovskii, 2005Stepanyants A. Chklovskii D.B. Neurogeometry and potential synaptic connectivity.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we itemized all the neuronal and non-neuronal cells in three cylindrical volumes that encompass apical dendrite segments of two cortical pyramidal cells, including their spines (Movie S10). We selected these particular apical dendrites because they ran very close to each other (see pink arrow in Figures 3A and 3D) and originated from nearby neuronal somata (in upper layer 6; red and green arrows in Figures 3A and 3D). Thus, they appeared to be in the same mini-column and perhaps participated in the same neural processing unit (Mountcastle, 1997Mountcastle V.B. The columnar organization of the neocortex.Brain. 1997; 120: 701-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). The three cylinder site was in layer 5, 100 \u03bcm and 135 \u03bcm superficial to the pseudo-colored \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d neuronal somata, respectively. Cross-sections of the annotations of two cylinders are shown in Figures 3B and 3D; reconstruction of the three cylinders is shown in Figure 3E; and the location of all three cylinders in the full volume is shown with pink arrows in Figures 3A, 3D, and 3O. These three slightly overlapping \u223c600 \u03bcm3 cylinders, two of which (cylinders 1 and 3) are centered on the \u201cred\u201d neuron\u2019s apical dendrite and one (cylinder 2) on the \u201cgreen\u201d apical dendrite, provided a total reconstructed volume of 1,500 \u03bcm3. In cylinder 3, rather than tracing the objects manually, we edited the computer-segmented data (Figure 3C). All of the 193 dendrites in this volume were traced out into the surrounding high-resolution cube, and some were traced onto the medium resolution data to locate somata (n = 30; Figure 3O). The 1,500 \u03bcm3 3 cylinder volume contains parts of many cells (Movies S10 and S11) and of a variety of types (Figures 3E\u20133N; Movie S11), including 193 dendrites, 92% spiny, the rest relatively smooth (Figures 3K and 3N), and 1,407 unmyelinated axons. Based on synapse appearance, 93% of the axons are excitatory (Figure 3I), and most of the remainder are inhibitory (Figure 3L). A few axons (5; \u223c0.5%), despite possessing vesicle-filled varicosities, did not establish classic close synaptic junctions with postsynaptic cells. In total, there were 1,700 synapses at a density of one synapse per 1.13 \u03bcm3 (Table S1). We also observed astrocytic processes (Figure 3J), myelinated axons (Figure 3F), oligodendrocyte processes (Figure 3G), and about 20 entities that we could not as easily classify (Figure 3M). Neuronal processes (axons and dendrites) occupy 92% of the cellular volume with glial processes, occupying much of the remaining 8% (Movies S9 and S10). The non-cellular (extracellular) space accounts for 6% of the total volume, less than half the extracellular space estimates from living brains, probably because of fixation-induced swelling (Vanharreveld et al., 1965Vanharreveld A. Crowell J. Malhotra S.K. A study of extracellular space in central nervous tissue by freeze-substitution.J. Cell Biol. 1965; 25: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The \u223c7-fold disparity between the number of axons and dendrites (1,407 versus 193) likely reflects a real difference in the numbers of pre- and postsynaptic cells that send processes into the volume. We analyzed the shape of the 660 excitatory axons that entered cylinder 1 and found that only three of them (0.5%) established branches that were non-terminal within the volume (Figure S3). To estimate the number of axons that branched outside the cylinders and sent more than one branch in, we analyzed axonal arbors from light microscopy reconstructions of mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons (NeuroMorpho.org; see the Methods) by superimposing them on the cylindrical volumes at random locations. The result of this analysis argues that only \u223c8 of the 1,308 excitatory axons (< 1%) in the volume are likely to be branches originating from the same parent neuron. Also, the dendrites in the cylinder only rarely originated from the same neuron: we found two dendritic shafts in cylinder 1 that were from the same neuron (out of 100). Presumably, therefore, axons extend into a 7-fold greater volume than dendrites, on average. The \u223c1,600 different neurons within this small region of mammalian brain (several billionths of the volume of a whole brain) is more than five times as many neurons as are contained within the entire nervous system of a Caenorhabditis elegans (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We created a spreadsheet of the 1,700 synaptic connections in the volume, providing the location of each, its pre- and postsynaptic partners, and a wide variety of other information (Table S1; http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/view\/highResAnnotated; http:\/\/openconnecto.me\/Kasthurietal2014\/data\/synapses). The spreadsheet shows that the connectivity is highly skewed toward excitatory elements: 92% (177\/193) of the dendrites are spiny and purportedly excitatory (Figure 3K; DeFelipe and Fari\u00f1as, 1992DeFelipe J. Fari\u00f1as I. The pyramidal neuron of the cerebral cortex: morphological and chemical characteristics of the synaptic inputs.Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and 93% (1,308\/1,407) of the axons are excitatory. Looking at each presynaptic varicosity, we found that 95% (1,610\/1,700) of them also meet the criteria for being excitatory. Each excitatory axon establishes slightly more synapses in the volume than each inhibitory axon (\u223c1.2 synapses\/excitatory axon versus \u223c0.9 synapses\/inhibitory). The excitatory-to-inhibitory-synapse ratio (van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996van Vreeswijk C. Sompolinsky H.

Abstract Despite a growing awareness that the herbaceous layer serves a special role in maintaining the structure and function of forests, this stratum remains an underappreciated aspect of forest ecosystems. In this article I review and synthesize information concerning the herb layer's structure, composition, and dynamics to emphasize its role as an integral component of forest ecosystems. Because species diversity is highest in the herb layer among all forest strata, forest biodiversity is largely a function of the herb-layer community. Competitive interactions within the herb layer can determine the initial success of plants occupying higher strata, including the regeneration of dominant overstory tree species. Furthermore, the herb layer and the overstory can become linked through parallel responses to similar environmental gradients. These relationships between strata vary both spatially and temporally. Because the herb layer responds sensitively to disturbance across broad spatial and temporal scales, its dynamics can provide important information regarding the site characteristics of forests, including patterns of past land-use practices. Thus, the herb layer has a significance that belies its diminutive stature.",

The most modest role for theories is to provide a classification into which facts can be arranged serving, as T. H. Huxley pointed out (in the days before computers), as an aid to the memory.

The emerging trends in the combinatorial chemistry and drug design have led to the development of drug candidates with greater lipophilicity, high molecular weight and poor water solubility. Majority of the failures in new drug development have been attributed to poor water solubility of the drug. Issues associated with poor solubility can lead to low bioavailability resulting in suboptimal drug delivery. About 40% of drugs with market approval and nearly 90% of molecules in the discovery pipeline are poorly water-soluble. With the advent of various insoluble drug delivery technologies, the challenge to formulate poorly water soluble drugs could be achieved. Numerous drugs associated with poor solubility and low bioavailabilities have been formulated into successful drug products. Several marketed drugs were reformulated to improve efficacy, safety and patient compliance. In order to gain marketing exclusivity and patent protection for such products, revitalization of poorly soluble drugs using insoluble drug delivery technologies have been successfully adopted by many pharmaceutical companies.

Hydrogen and fuel cells can be utilised in transportation, distributed heat and power generation, and energy storage systems. However, the transition from a carbon-based (fossil fuel) energy system to a hydrogen-based economy involves significant scientific, technological and socioeconomic barriers to the implementation of hydrogen and fuel cells as clean energy technologies of the future. This paper aims to capture, in brief, the current status, key scientific and technical challenges and projection of hydrogen and fuel cells within a sustainable energy vision of the future. We offer no comments here on energy policy and strategy.

    "text":"Fractional quantum Hall effect and insulating phase of Dirac electrons in graphene. In graphene, which is an atomic layer of crystalline carbon, two of the distinguishing properties of the material are the charge carriers two-dimensional and relativistic character. The first experimental evidence of the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an applied magnetic field. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue. As a third distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly, evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the quintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite intense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence. Here we report the observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by using suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport measurements. This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced perturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system and to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a field-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing its observation only in the highest quality samples. We believe that these results will open the door to the physics of FQHE and other collective behaviour in graphene.",

It has been forty years since Mullins [Mullins L. Softening of rubber by deformation. Rubber Chem Technol 1969;42:339\u201362.] wrote his review on the phenomenon and still no general agreement has been found either on the physical source or on the mechanical modeling of this effect. Therefore, we reviewed the literature dedicated to this topic over the past six decades. We present the experimental evidences, which characterize the Mullins softening. The phenomenon is observed in filled rubbers and crystallizing pure gum. Then, the phenomenological models dedicated to fit the mechanical behavior of rubbers undergoing some Mullins softening are studied. To overcome the limit of a descriptive phenomenological modeling, several authors looked for a physical understanding of the phenomenon. Various theories have been proposed, but none of them has been supported unanimously. Nonetheless, these theories favor the emergence of physically based mechanical behavior laws. We tested some of these laws, which show little predictive abilities since the values of their parameters either cannot be measured experimentally or do not compare well with the physical quantities they are linked to.",

[1] The Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) has been designed to measure size-resolved mass distributions and total mass loadings of volatile and semivolatile chemical species in\/on submicron particles. This paper describes the application of this instrument to ambient aerosol sampling. The AMS uses an aerodynamic lens to focus the particles into a narrow beam, a roughened cartridge heater to vaporize them under high vacuum, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer to analyze the vaporized molecules. Particle size is measured via particle time-of-flight. The AMS is operated in two modes: (1) a continuous mass spectrum mode without size information; and (2) a size distribution measurement mode for selected m\/z settings of the quadrupole. Single particles can also be detected and sized if they have enough mass of a chemical component. The AMS was deployed at a ground sampling site near downtown Atlanta during August 1999, as part of the Environmental Protection Agency\/Southern Oxidant Study Particulate Matter \u201cSupersite\u201d experiment, and at a suburban location in the Boston area during September 1999. The major observed components of the aerosol at both sites were sulfate and organics with a minor fraction of nitrate, consistent with prior studies and colocated instruments. Different aerosol chemical components often had different size distributions and time evolutions. More than half of the sulfate mass was contained in 2% of the ambient particles in one of the sampling periods. Trends in mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate measured with the AMS in Atlanta compare well with those measured with ion chromatography-based instruments. A marked diurnal cycle was observed for aerosol nitrate in Atlanta. A simple model fit is used to illustrate the integration of data from several chemical components measured by the AMS together with data from other particle instruments into a coherent representation of the ambient aerosol.",

Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp\/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms.

Cellular delivery involving the transfer of various drugs and bio-active molecules (peptides, proteins and DNAs, etc.) through the cell membrane into cells has attracted increasing attention because of its importance in medicine and drug delivery. This topic has been extensively reviewed. The direct delivery of drugs and biomolecules, however, is generally inefficient and suffering from problems such as enzymic degradation of DNAs. Therefore, searching for efficient and safe transport vehicles (carriers) to delivery genes or drugs into cells has been challenging yet exciting area of research. In past decades, many carriers have been developed and investigated extensively which can be generally classified into four major groups: viral carriers, organic cationic compounds, recombinant protiens and inorganic nanoparticles. Many inorganic materials, such as calcium phosphate, gold, carbon materials, silicon oxide, iron oxide and layered double hydroxide (LDH), have been studied. Inorganic nanoparticles show low toxicity and promise for controlled delivery properties, thus presenting a new alternative to viral carriers and cationic carriers. Inorganic nanoparticles generally possess versatile properties suitable for cellular delivery, including wide availability, rich functionality, good biocompatibility, potential capability of targeted delivery (e.g. selectively destroying cancer cells but sparing normal tissues) and controlled release of carried drugs. This paper reviews the latest advances in inorganic nanoparticle applications as cellular delivery carriers and highlights some key issues in efficient cellular delivery using inorganic nanoparticles. Critical properties of inorganic nanoparticles, surface functionalisation (modification), uptake of biomolecules, the driving forces for delivery, and release of biomolecules will be reviewed systematically. Selected examples of promising inorganic nanoparticle delivery systems, including gold, fullerences and carbon nanotubes, LDH and various oxide nanoparticles in particular their applications for gene delivery will be discussed.

Almost 5\u20137% of global CO2 emissions are caused by cement plants, while 900 kg CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere for producing one ton of cement. In this work, global strategies and potentials toward mitigation of CO2 emissions in cement plant have been discussed and the most promising approaches have been introduced. Moreover the barriers against worldwide deployment of such strategies are identified and comprehensively described. Three strategies of CO2 reduction including energy saving, carbon separation and storage as well as utilizing alternative materials in detail have been reviewed. In case of energy saving approaches, shifting to more efficient process for example from wet to dry process with calciner, shows the best results since potentially reduces up to 50% of required energy and mitigates almost 20% of CO2 emissions in the process. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is also considered as an effective way to avoid release of CO2. However economical and technical challenges still play a remarkable obstacle against implementing such processes in the cement plant. As far as alternative materials are the case, utilizing waste-derived fuel (WDF) and industrial by-products instead of conventional fuels and materials result in the significant emission mitigation. Industrial wastes which can be used as both fuel and raw material simultaneously mitigate emissions in cement plants and landfills.",

However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.",

Subsequently, increasing complexity on all firm levels creates uncertainty about respective organizational and technological capabilities and adequate strategies to develop them. In this paper we propose an empirically grounded novel model and its implementation to assess the Industry 4.0 maturity of industrial enterprises in the domain of discrete manufacturing. Our main goal was to extend the dominating technology focus of recently developed models by including organizational aspects. Overall we defined 9 dimensions and assigned 62 items to them for assessing Industry 4.0 maturity.

This study makes a new estimate of the global historical production for perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF), and then focuses on producing a first estimate of the global historical environmental releases of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The total historical worldwide production of POSF was estimated to be 96,000 t (or 122,500 t, including unusable wastes) between 1970-2002, with an estimated global release of 45,250 t to air and water between 1970-2012 from direct (manufacture, use, and consumer products) and indirect (PFOS precursors and\/or impurities) sources. Estimates indicate that direct emissions from POSF-derived products are the major source to the environment resulting in releases of 450-2700 t PFOS into wastewater streams, primarily through losses from stain repellent treated carpets, waterproof apparel, and aqueous fire fighting foams. Large uncertainties surround indirect sources and have not yet been estimated due to limited information on environmental degradation, although it can be assumed that some POSF-derived chemicals will degrade to PFOS over time. The properties of PFOS (high water solubility, negligible vapor pressure, and limited sorption to particles) imply it will reside in surface waters, predominantly in oceans. Measured oceanic data suggests approximately 235-1770 t of PFOS currently reside in ocean surface waters, similar to the estimated PFOS releases. Environmental monitoring from the 1970s onward shows strong upward trends in biota, in broad agreement with the estimates of use and emissions made here. Since cessation of POSF production by 3M in 2002, a reduction in some compartments has been observed, although current and future exposure is dependent on emission routes, subsequent transport and degradation.",

Abstract To improve the sustainability of transportation, a major goal is the replacement of conventional petroleum-based fuels with more sustainable fuels that can be used in the existing infrastructure (fuel distribution and vehicles). While fossil-derived synthetic fuels (e.g. coal derived liquid fuels) and biofuels have received the most attention, similar hydrocarbons can be produced without using fossil fuels or biomass. Using renewable and\/or nuclear energy, carbon dioxide and water can be recycled into liquid hydrocarbon fuels in non-biological processes which remove oxygen from CO2 and H2O (the reverse of fuel combustion). Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere would enable a closed-loop carbon-neutral fuel cycle. This article critically reviews the many possible technological pathways for recycling CO2 into fuels using renewable or nuclear energy, considering three stages\u2014CO2 capture, H2O and CO2 dissociation, and fuel synthesis. Dissociation methods include thermolysis, thermochemical cycles, electrolysis, and photoelectrolysis of CO2 and\/or H2O. High temperature co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 makes very efficient use of electricity and heat (near-100% electricity-to-syngas efficiency), provides high reaction rates, and directly produces syngas (CO\/H2 mixture) for use in conventional catalytic fuel synthesis reactors. Capturing CO2 from the atmosphere using a solid sorbent, electrolyzing H2O and CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells to yield syngas, and converting the syngas to gasoline or diesel by Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis is identified as one of the most promising, feasible routes. An analysis of the energy balance and economics of this CO2 recycling process is presented. We estimate that the full system can feasibly operate at 70% electricity-to-liquid fuel efficiency (higher heating value basis) and the price of electricity needed to produce synthetic gasoline at U.S.D$ 2\/gal ($ 0.53\/L) is 2\u20133\u00a0U.S. cents\/kWh. For $ 3\/gal ($ 0.78\/L) gasoline, electricity at 4\u20135\u00a0cents\/kWh is needed. In some regions that have inexpensive renewable electricity, such as Iceland, fuel production may already be economical. The dominant costs of the process are the electricity cost and the capital cost of the electrolyzer, and this capital cost is significantly increased when operating intermittently (on renewable power sources such as solar and wind). The potential of this CO2 recycling process is assessed, in terms of what technological progress is needed to achieve large-scale, economically competitive production of sustainable fuels by this method.",

On the phenotypical side, an ever-increasing number of very varied and distinctive influences of antimicrobial peptides on the innate immune system are reported. The basic biophysical understanding of mammalian antimicrobial peptides, however, is still very limited. This is especially unsatisfactory since knowledge of structural properties will greatly help in the understanding of their immunomodulatory functions. The focus of this review article will be on LL-37, the only cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide found in humans.

Abstract The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis asserts that pollution follows an inverted-U path with respect to economic growth.

While some authors have incorporated the impact of trade policy orientation on the EKC, the impact of the actual movement between countries of goods that embody pollution has not been considered. This paper attempts to econometrically quantify the effect using pooled cross-country and time-series data. The EKC hypothesis is examined with respect to commercial energy consumption, the source of many serious environmental problems. It was found that while both industrializing and industrialized countries have added to their energy requirements by exporting manufactured goods, the growth has been substantially higher in the former. At the same time, industrialized countries have been able to reduce their energy requirements by importing manufactured goods. Exports of manufactured goods by industrialized countries has thus been an important factor in generating the upward sloping portion of the EKC and imports by industrialized countries have contributed to the downward slope.",

This paper presents an overview of research related to mercury control technology for coal-fired power plants and identifies areas requiring additional research and development. It critically reviews measured mercury emissions; the chemistry of mercury transformation and control; progress in the development of promising control technologies: sorbent injection, control in wet scrubbers, and coal cleaning; and projects costs for mercury control. Currently, there is no single best technology that can be broadly applied. Combinations of available control methods may be able to provide up to 90% control for some plants but not others.\r\n\r\nIn August 2000, the National Research Council completed a study that determined that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) conservative exposure reference dose of 0.1 \u03bcg mercury\/kg body weight\/day was scientifically justified to protect against harmful neurological effects during fetal development and early childhood. Subsequently, in December 2000, EPA made its regulatory decision that mercury emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants will need to be controlled on a schedule that calls for a proposed rule by December 2003, a final rule by December 2004, and full compliance by the end of 2007.\r\n\r\nCoal-fired utility boilers are currently the largest single-known source of mercury emissions in the United States. EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR) to coal-burning utilities indicated that there were 75 tons of mercury in the 900 million tons of coal used in U.S. power plants during 1999. Estimates of total mercury emissions from coal-fired plants based on ICR data range from 40 to 52 tons. On average, about 40% of the mercury entering a coal-fired power plant is captured and 60% emitted.\r\n\r\nPercentage emissions of mercury for individual plants tested under the ICR varied widely depending on coal type and emission control equipment. Western subbituminous coals on average contain only about half as much mercury as Appalachian bituminous coals, but the higher chlorine content of the latter promotes mercury oxidation and results in a higher percentage of mercury capture. Some iron minerals found in coal also catalyze mercury oxidation, whereas calcium and sulfur tend to impede oxidation.\r\n\r\nReview of ICR data on mercury capture in boilers and existing control devices indicates very little mercury removal within a pulverized coal-fired boiler, and the level of mercury oxidation at the exit of the boiler was increased for higher coal chlorine contents and lower exit temperatures. Mercury removals across cold-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) averaged 27%, compared to 4% for hot-side ESPs. Removals for fabric filters (FFs) were higher, averaging 58%, owing to additional gas\u2013solid contact time for oxidation. Both wet and dry flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems removed 80% to 90% of the gaseous mercury(II), but elemental mercury (Hg0) was not affected. High mercury removals, averaging 86%, in fluidized-bed combustors with FFs were attributed to mercury capture on high-carbon fly ash. Tests on the two coal-fired integrated gasification combined-cycle plants in the United States suggest that about half of the coal mercury was emitted predominantly in elemental form. ICR tests on selective catalytic reduction and selective noncatalytic reduction used for NOx control were inconclusive, and additional full-scale tests are in progress.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms responsible for varied levels of mercury oxidation and capture are beginning to be understood. Mercury in coal occurs in association with pyrite and other sulfide minerals and may also be organically bound. Coal mercury is converted to gaseous Hg0 in the combustion flame and is subsequently partially oxidized (35% to 95%) as the combustion gases cool. Mercury oxidation in boiler systems is kinetically controlled; homogeneous oxidation reactions are promoted by chlorine and atomic chlorine, and heterogeneous oxidation is promoted by fly ash and sorbents. Acid gases critically influence the heterogeneous oxidation of mercury, particularly as it affects capture on sorbents. HCl, NO, and NO2 all promote oxidation and capture both individually and in combination. However, the combination of SO2 with NO2 greatly reduces capture of Hg0 on activated carbon, whereas oxidation continues on the solid surface.\r\n\r\nMass transfer of gaseous mercury by diffusion from the bulk gas to the solid surface can also limit heterogeneous oxidation and capture of mercury, but diffusion within a porous sorbent is not believed to be rate-limiting. Reducing the size of the sorbent particles and increasing their dispersion can greatly enhance control where mass transfer is limiting. To achieve 90% control of a mercury concentration of 10 \u03bcg\/scm in 2-s residence time by activated carbon injection requires a minimum carbon-to-mercury (C\/Hg) mass ratio of about 3000:1 for 4-\u03bcm particles compared to 18,000:1 for 10-\u03bcm particles. Mercury removals in some tests performed to characterize sorbents have been mass transfer-limited by the large particle size of the sorbents used.\r\n\r\nMercury sorption capacities between about 200 and 5000 \u03bcg Hg\/g C have been reported for conditions applying to coal combustion. However, higher measured capacities do not always correlate with higher removal levels in practice because of the effect of other variables. What is important is that several of the activated carbons tested have sufficient capacity to capture mercury at carbon injection rates below a C\/Hg mass ratio of 10,000, based on both laboratory and field sorption tests. Since capacity is defined in reference to an assumed sorption equilibrium, the equilibrium capacity of a sorbent determined over a period of hours in the laboratory may have limited relevance to the amount of mercury captured in a few seconds' time of flight or in minutes of contact time on an FF. Laboratory tests that are more representative of the conditions in an actual control device are needed to determine more useful capacity factors.\r\n\r\nInjection of activated carbon upstream of either an ESP or an FF baghouse is a retrofit control technology that has potential application to 75% of all coal-fired power plants in the United States that are not equipped with FGD scrubbers. Field and pilot-scale tests on activated carbon injection for mercury control have resulted in mercury removals between about 25% and 95% over the range of 2000\u201315,000 C\/Hg mass ratio. The mercury removal data from some tests could be correlated with carbon injection rates by assuming that the removal was mass transfer-limited, whereas in tests on other coals, removals appeared to be controlled by catalytic oxidation and capture on fly ash. Mercury capture on sorbents, therefore, depends on the properties of the coal being burned, and pilot-scale tests on particular coals should be performed before a full-scale sorbent injection system is designed. Development of low-cost, ultrafine sorbents with high effective sorption capacities and rapid reaction kinetics would revolutionize injection technology. Engineering development is also needed to improve sorbent dispersion and to optimize gas\u2013solid contact time.\r\n\r\nWet FGD units currently installed on about 25% of the U.S. coal-fired utility boilers remove nearly 90% of the mercury(II) entering but essentially none of the Hg0. Research to enhance mercury removal in scrubbers focuses on converting Hg0 to an oxidized form in or ahead of the scrubber using proprietary reagents. Palladium and carbon-based catalysts have shown the most promise for oxidizing Hg0.\r\n\r\nMercury removals from near 0% to about 60% are reported for the physical washing methods of the type that are widely used to remove pyritic sulfur and ash from 77% of all bituminous coal used in the United States. Advanced cleaning methods and hydrothermal treatment offer higher removals, but no coal-cleaning method is likely to reliably meet a 70% or greater removal requirement. Coal cleaning could, however, contribute to overall mercury control under a cap-and-trade form of mercury regulation.\r\n\r\nConcerns over the release of mercury from coal combustion by-products by leaching or atmospheric reemission will be heightened with the installation of mercury control technologies. Concentrations of mercury in leachates from fly ashes, FGD materials, and activated carbon saturated with mercury are very low and usually below detection limits. Essentially, no mercury emission from these materials into air has been measured at ambient temperature. However, mercury is released from saturated sorbents upon heating above 135 \u00b0C. Preliminary results on the stability of mercury on fly ash, FGD materials, and saturated carbons are encouraging, but more testing is needed before the concerns are fully resolved.",

    "text":"VirSorter: mining viral signal from microbial genomic data. Viruses of microbes impact all ecosystems where microbes drive key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans, humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms or genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing. Here, we present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral signal in these different types of microbial sequence data in both a reference-dependent and reference-independent manner, leveraging probabilistic models and extensive virome data to maximize detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows that VirSorter\u2019s prophage prediction capability compares to that of available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and metagenomic datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled sequence (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect identification (>95% Recall and 100% Precision) on contigs of at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it can also be used in \u201creverse\u201d to more confidently identify viral sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a web-based user interface interconnected with the required computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing prophage prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG and metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse ecosystems.",

While the low sensitivity of FET biosensors based on bulk 3D structures has been overcome by using 1D structures (nanotubes\/nanowires), the latter face severe fabrication challenges, impairing their practical applications. In this paper, we introduce and demonstrate FET biosensors based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which provides extremely high sensitivity and at the same time offers easy patternability and device fabrication, due to its 2D atomically layered structure. A MoS2-based pH sensor achieving sensitivity as high as 713 for a pH change by 1 unit along with efficient operation over a wide pH range (3\u20139) is demonstrated. Ultrasensitive and specific protein sensing is also achieved with a sensitivity of 196 even at 100 femtomolar concentration. While graphene is also a 2D material, we show here that it cannot compete with a MoS2-based FET biosensor, which surpasses the sensitivity of that based on graphene by more than 74-fold. Moreover, we establish through theoretical analysis that MoS2 is greatly advantageous for biosensor device scaling without compromising its sensitivity, which is beneficial for single molecular detection. Furthermore, MoS2, with its highly flexible and transparent nature, can offer new opportunities in advanced diagnostics and medical prostheses. This unique fusion of desirable properties makes MoS2 a highly potential candidate for next-generation low-cost biosensors.",

Bilayer parameters, such as area per lipid and overall bilayer thickness have been obtained in conjunction with intrabilayer structural parameters (e.g. hydrocarbon region thickness). The results have allowed us to assess the effect of temperature and hydrocarbon chain composition on bilayer structure. For example, we found that for all lipids there is, not surprisingly, an increase in fatty acid chain trans-gauche isomerization with increasing temperature. Moreover, this increase in trans-gauche isomerization scales with fatty acid chain length in mixed chain lipids. However, in the case of lipids with saturated fatty acid chains, trans-gauche isomerization is increasingly tempered by attractive chain-chain van der Waals interactions with increasing chain length.

Mixed Ni-Fe oxides are attractive anode catalysts for efficient water splitting in solar fuels reactors. Because of conflicting past reports, the catalytically active metal redox state of the catalyst has remained under debate. Here, we report an in operando quantitative deconvolution of the charge injected into the nanostructured Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide OER catalysts or into reaction product molecules. To achieve this, we explore the oxygen evolution reaction dynamics and the individual faradaic charge efficiencies using operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). We further use X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) under OER conditions at the Ni and Fe K-edges of the electrocatalysts to evaluate oxidation states and local atomic structure motifs. DEMS and XAS data consistently reveal that up to 75% of the Ni centers increase their oxidation state from +2 to +3, while up to 25% arrive in the +4 state for the NiOOH catalyst under OER catalysis. The Fe centers consistently remain in the +3 state, regardless of potential and composition. For mixed Ni100-xFex catalysts, where x exceeds 9 atomic %, the faradaic efficiency of O2 sharply increases from \u223c30% to 90%, suggesting that Ni atoms largely remain in the oxidation state +2 under catalytic conditions. To reconcile the apparent low level of oxidized Ni in mixed Ni-Fe catalysts, we hypothesize that a kinetic competition between the (i) metal oxidation process and the (ii) metal reduction step during O2 release may account for an insignificant accumulation of detectable high-valent metal states if the reaction rate of process (ii) outweighs that of (i). We conclude that a discussion of the superior catalytic OER activity of Ni-FeOOH electrocatalysts in terms of surface catalysis and redox-inactive metal sites likely represents an oversimplification that fails to capture essential aspects of the synergisms at highly active Ni-Fe sites.",

Neonicotinoids, broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, are the fastest growing class of insecticides worldwide and are now registered for use on hundreds of field crops in over 120 different countries. The environmental profile of this class of pesticides indicate that they are persistent, have high leaching and runoff potential, and are highly toxic to a wide range of invertebrates. Therefore, neonicotinoids represent a significant risk to surface waters and the diverse aquatic and terrestrial fauna that these ecosystems support. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the reported concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface waters from 29 studies in 9 countries world-wide in tandem with published data on their acute and chronic toxicity to 49 species of aquatic insects and crustaceans spanning 12 invertebrate orders. Strong evidence exists that water-borne neonicotinoid exposures are frequent, long-term and at levels (geometric means = 0.13 \u03bcg\/L (averages) and 0.63 \u03bcg\/L (maxima)) which commonly exceed several existing water quality guidelines. Imidacloprid is by far the most widely studied neonicotinoid (66% of the 214 toxicity tests reviewed) with differences in sensitivity among aquatic invertebrate species ranging several orders of magnitude; other neonicotinoids display analogous modes of action and similar toxicities, although comparative data are limited. Of the species evaluated, insects belonging to the orders Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Diptera appear to be the most sensitive, while those of Crustacea (although not universally so) are less sensitive. In particular, the standard test species Daphnia magna appears to be very tolerant, with 24\u201396 hour LC50 values exceeding 100,000 \u03bcg\/L (geometric mean > 44,000 \u03bcg\/L), which is at least 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than the geometric mean of all other invertebrate species tested. Overall, neonicotinoids can exert adverse effects on survival, growth, emergence, mobility, and behavior of many sensitive aquatic invertebrate taxa at concentrations at or below 1 \u03bcg\/L under acute exposure and 0.1 \u03bcg\/L for chronic exposure. Using probabilistic approaches (species sensitivity distributions), we recommend here that ecological thresholds for neonicotinoid water concentrations need to be below 0.2 \u03bcg\/L (short-term acute) or 0.035 \u03bcg\/L (long-term chronic) to avoid lasting effects on aquatic invertebrate communities. The application of safety factors may still be warranted considering potential issues of slow recovery, additive or synergistic effects and multiple stressors that can occur in the field. Our analysis revealed that 81% (22\/27) and 74% (14\/19) of global surface water studies reporting maximum and average individual neonicotinoid concentrations respectively, exceeded these thresholds of 0.2 and 0.035 \u03bcg\/L. Therefore, it appears that environmentally relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface waters worldwide are well within the range where both short- and long-term impacts on aquatic invertebrate species are possible over broad spatial scales.",

Analyses of 43 ecosystem attributes from 244 case studies worldwide showed that some attributes consistently increased with encroachment (e.g. soil C, N), and others declined (e.g. grass cover, pH), but most exhibited variable responses. Traits of shrubs were associated with significant, though weak, structural and functional outcomes of encroachment. Our review revealed that encroachment had mixed effects on ecosystem structure and functioning at global scales, and that shrub traits influence the functional outcome of encroachment. Thus, a simple designation of encroachment as a process leading to functionally, structurally or contextually degraded ecosystems is not supported by a critical analysis of existing literature.

Catalytic processes have remarkably boosted the rapid industrializations in chemical production, energy conversion, and environmental remediation. As one of the emerging applications of carbocatalysis, metal-free nanocarbons have demonstrated promise as catalysts for green remediation technologies to overcome the poor stability and undesirable metal leaching in metal-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Since our reports of heterogeneous activation of persulfates with low-dimensional nanocarbons, the novel oxidative system has raised tremendous interest for degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater without secondary contamination. In this Account, we showcase our recent contributions to metal-free catalysis in advanced oxidation, including design of nanocarbon catalysts, exploration of intrinsic active sites, and identification of reactive species and reaction pathways, and we offer perspectives on carbocatalysis for future environmental applications. The journey starts with the discovery of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation by graphene-based materials. With the systematic investigations on most carbon allotropes, for the first time the carbocatalysis for PMS or PDS activation was correlated with the pristine carbon configuration, oxygen functionality (ketonic groups), defect degree (exposed edge sites and vacancies), and dimensional structure. Moreover, an intrinsic difference in catalytic oxidation does exist between PMS and PDS activation. For example, the PMS\/carbon reaction is dominated by free radicals, while PDS\/carbon catalysis was unveiled as a singlet oxygen- or nonradical-based process in which the surface-activated PDS complex directly degrades the organic pollutants without relying on the generation of free radicals. Nitrogen doping significantly enhances the carbocatalysis because of the positively charged carbon domains, which strongly bind with persulfates to form reactive intermediates toward organic reactions. More importantly, N doping substantially alters the catalytic oxidation from a radical process to a nonradical pathway in PMS activation. Codoping of sulfur or boron with nitrogen at a rational level will synergistically promote the catalysis as a result of the formation of more catalytic centers by improved charge\/spin redistribution of the carbon framework. Furthermore, a structure-performance relationship was established for annealed nanodiamonds with a characteristic sp3\/sp2 (core\/shell) hybridization, where the catalytic pathways were intimately dependent on the thickness of the graphitic shells. Interestingly, the introduction of structural defects and N dopants into the well-defined graphitic carbon framework and alteration of graphene\/diamond hybrids can transform the persulfate\/carbon system from a radical oxidation pathway to a nonradical pathway. Encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within carbon layers further modulates the electronic states of the interacting carbon via charge transport to increase the electron density. Overall, this Account contributes to unveiling the mist of carbocatalysis in AOPs and to summarizing the achievements of metal-free remediation. We also present future research directions on underpinning the knowledge base to facilitate the applications of nanocarbons in sustainable catalysis and environmental chemistry.",

We have developed oxidized copper catalysts displaying lower overpotentials for carbon dioxide electroreduction and record selectivity towards ethylene (60%) through facile and tunable plasma treatments. Herein we provide insight into the improved performance of these catalysts by combining electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy show that copper oxides are surprisingly resistant to reduction and copper + species remain on the surface during the reaction. Our results demonstrate that the roughness of oxide-derived copper catalysts plays only a partial role in determining the catalytic performance, while the presence of copper + is key for lowering the onset potential and enhancing ethylene selectivity.",

Initial studies of climate change on crops focussed on effects of increased carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) level and\/or global mean temperature and\/or rainfall and nutrition on crop production. However, crops can respond nonlinearly to changes in their growing conditions, exhibit threshold responses and are subject to combinations of stress factors that affect their growth, development and yield. Thus, climate variability and changes in the frequency of extreme events are important for yield, its stability and quality. In this context, threshold temperatures for crop processes are found not to differ greatly for different crops and are important to define for the major food crops, to assist climate modellers predict the occurrence of crop critical temperatures and their temporal resolution. This paper demonstrates the impacts of climate variability for crop production in a number of crops. Increasing temperature and precipitation variability increases the risks to yield, as shown via computer simulation and experimental studies. The issue of food quality has not been given sufficient importance when assessing the impact of climate change for food and this is addressed. Using simulation models of wheat, the concentration of grain protein is shown to respond to changes in the mean and variability of temperature and precipitation events. The paper concludes with discussion of adaptation possibilities for crops in response to drought and argues that characters that enable better exploration of the soil and slower leaf canopy expansion could lead to crop higher transpiration efficiency.",

Thus, the epistemic resources for presenting mechanistic explanations are considerably richer than those suggested by a nomological framework. Second, the fact that mechanisms involve organized systems of component parts and operations provides direction to both the discovery and testing of mechanistic explanations.

Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund \u2013Potsdam \u2013 Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere \u2013 hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world\u2019s major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract This paper describes the mean ocean circulation and the tropical variability simulated by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). Results are presented from a version of the coupled model that served as a prototype for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) simulations. The model does not require flux adjustment to maintain a stable climate. A control simulation with present-day greenhouse gases is analyzed, and the simulation of key oceanic features, such as sea surface temperatures (SSTs), large-scale circulation, meridional heat and freshwater transports, and sea ice are compared with observations. A parameterization that accounts for the effect of ocean currents on surface wind stress is implemented in the model. The largest impact of this parameterization is in the tropical Pacific, where the mean state is significantly improved: the strength of the trade winds and the associated equatorial upwelling weaken, and there is a reduction of the model\u2019s equatorial cold SST bias by more than 1 K. Equatorial SST variability also becomes more realistic. The strength of the variability is reduced by about 30% in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the extension of SST variability into the warm pool is significantly reduced. The dominant El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) period shifts from 3 to 4 yr. Without the parameterization an unrealistically strong westward propagation of SST anomalies is simulated. The reasons for the changes in variability are linked to changes in both the mean state and to a reduction in atmospheric sensitivity to SST changes and oceanic sensitivity to wind anomalies.",

    "text":"Oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized coal: Characterization, fundamentals, stabilization and CFD modeling. Oxy-fuel combustion has generated significant interest since it was proposed as a carbon capture technology for newly built and retrofitted coal-fired power plants. Research, development and demonstration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies has been advancing in recent years; however, there are still fundamental issues and technological challenges that must be addressed before this technology can reach its full potential, especially in the areas of combustion in oxygen-carbon dioxide environments and potentially at elevated pressures. This paper presents a technical review of oxy-coal combustion covering the most recent experimental and simulation studies, and numerical models for sub-processes are also used to examine the differences between combustion in an oxidizing stream diluted by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The evolution of this technology from its original inception for high temperature processes to its current form for carbon capture is introduced, followed by a discussion of various oxy-fuel systems proposed for carbon capture. Of all these oxy-fuel systems, recent research has primarily focused on atmospheric air-like oxy-fuel combustion in a CO2-rich environment. Distinct heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction kinetics, have been reported in this environment because of the difference between the physical and chemical properties of CO2 and N2, which in turn changes the flame characteristics. By tracing the physical and chemical processes that coal particles experience during combustion, the characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion are reviewed in the context of heat and mass transfer, fuel delivery and injection, coal particle heating and moisture evaporation, devolatilization and ignition, char oxidation and gasification, as well as pollutants formation. Operation under elevated pressures has also been proposed for oxy-coal combustion systems in order to improve the overall energy efficiency. The potential impact of elevated pressures on oxy-fuel combustion is discussed when applicable. Narrower flammable regimes and lower laminar burning velocity under oxy-fuel combustion conditions may lead to new stability challenges in operating oxy-coal burners. Recent research on stabilization of oxy-fuel combustion is reviewed, and some guiding principles for retrofit are summarized. Distinct characteristics in oxy-coal combustion necessitate modifications of CFD sub-models because the approximations and assumptions for air-fuel combustion may no longer be valid. Advances in sub-models for turbulent flow, heat transfer and reactions in oxy-coal combustion simulations, and the results obtained using CFD are reviewed. Based on the review, research needs in this combustion technology are suggested.",

SNG production from coal or biomass is considered again due to rising prices for natural gas, the wish for less dependency from natural gas imports and the opportunity of reducing green house gases by CO2 capture and sequestration. Coal and solid dry biomass (e.g., wood and straw) have to be converted to SNG by thermo-chemical processes (gasification followed by gas cleaning, conditioning, methanation of the producer gas and subsequent gas upgrading). During the 1970s, a number of methanation processes have been developed comprising both fixed bed and fluidised bed methanation. Meanwhile several new processes are under development, especially with a focus on the conversion of biomass. While coal based systems usually involve high pressure cold gas cleaning steps, biomass based systems require, due to the smaller unit size, different gas cleaning strategies. Moreover, the ethylene content of a few percent, typical for methane-rich producer gas from biomass gasifiers, is a challenge for the long-term catalyst stability in adiabatic fixed bed methanation due to the inherent high temperatures. This paper reviews the processes developed for the production of SNG from coal during the sixties and seventies and the recent developments for SNG production from coal and from dry biomass.",

The air bubbles trapped in the Antarctic Vostok and EPICA Dome C ice cores provide composite records of levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane covering the past 650,000 years. Now the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations has been extended by two more complete glacial cycles to 800,000 years ago. The new data are from the lowest 200 metres of the Dome C core. This ice core went down to just a few metres above bedrock at a depth of 3,260 metres. Two papers report analyses of this deep ice, including the lowest carbon dioxide concentration so far measured in an ice core. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout the eight glacial cycles, but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 years before present. The cover shows a strip of ice core from an Antarctic ice core from Berkner Island, this slice from a depth of 120 metres. Photo by Chris Gilbert, British Antarctic Survey. Elsewhere in this issue, we move from climates past to future plans for climate prediction. A detailed atmospheric methane record from the EPICA Dome C ice core that extends the history of atmospheric methane to 800,000 years before present is detailed. Spectral analyses indicate that the long-term variability in atmospheric methane levels is dominated by \u223c100,000 year glacial\u2013interglacial cycles up to \u223c400,000 years ago with an increasing contribution of the precessional component during the four more recent climatic cycles. Atmospheric methane is an important greenhouse gas and a sensitive indicator of climate change and millennial-scale temperature variability1. Its concentrations over the past 650,000 years have varied between \u223c350 and \u223c800 parts per 109 by volume (p.p.b.v.) during glacial and interglacial periods, respectively2. In comparison, present-day methane levels of \u223c1,770 p.p.b.v. have been reported3. Insights into the external forcing factors and internal feedbacks controlling atmospheric methane are essential for predicting the methane budget in a warmer world3. Here we present a detailed atmospheric methane record from the EPICA Dome C ice core that extends the history of this greenhouse gas to 800,000 yr before present. The average time resolution of the new data is \u223c380 yr and permits the identification of orbital and millennial-scale features. Spectral analyses indicate that the long-term variability in atmospheric methane levels is dominated by \u223c100,000 yr glacial\u2013interglacial cycles up to \u223c400,000 yr ago with an increasing contribution of the precessional component during the four more recent climatic cycles. We suggest that changes in the strength of tropical methane sources and sinks (wetlands, atmospheric oxidation), possibly influenced by changes in monsoon systems and the position of the intertropical convergence zone, controlled the atmospheric methane budget, with an additional source input during major terminations as the retreat of the northern ice sheet allowed higher methane emissions from extending periglacial wetlands. Millennial-scale changes in methane levels identified in our record as being associated with Antarctic isotope maxima events1,4 are indicative of ubiquitous millennial-scale temperature variability during the past eight glacial cycles.",

However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a poorly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition. Recently, it has been shown that TTS may be associated with severe clinical complications including death and that its prevalence is probably underestimated. Since current guidelines on TTS are lacking, it appears timely and important to provide an expert consensus statement on TTS. The clinical expert consensus document part I summarizes the current state of knowledge on clinical presentation and characteristics of TTS and agrees on controversies surrounding TTS such as nomenclature, different TTS types, role of coronary artery disease, and etiology. This consensus also proposes new diagnostic criteria based on current knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

    "text":"Biodiversity and Resilience of Ecosystem Functions. Accelerating rates of environmental change and the continued loss of global biodiversity threaten functions and services delivered by ecosystems. Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their 'resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.",

    "text":"Surface Plasmon Resonance: A Versatile Technique for Biosensor Applications. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a label-free detection method which has emerged during the last two decades as a suitable and reliable platform in clinical analysis for biomolecular interactions. The technique makes it possible to measure interactions in real-time with high sensitivity and without the need of labels. This review article discusses a wide range of applications in optical-based sensors using either surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI). Here we summarize the principles, provide examples, and illustrate the utility of SPR and SPRI through example applications from the biomedical, proteomics, genomics and bioengineering fields. In addition, SPR signal amplification strategies and surface functionalization are covered in the review.",

    "text":"Cellulose nanowhiskers from coconut husk fibers: Effect of preparation conditions on their thermal and morphological behavior. Cellulose nanowhiskers were prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis from coconut husk fibers which had previously been submitted to a delignification process. The effects of preparation conditions on the thermal and morphological behavior of the nanocrystals were investigated. Cellulose nanowhisker suspensions were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction. Results showed that it was possible to obtain ultrathin cellulose nanowhiskers with diameters as low as 5 nm and aspect ratio of up to 60. A possible correlation between preparation conditions and particle size was not observed. Higher residual lignin content was found to increase thermal stability indicating that by controlling reaction conditions one can tailor the thermal properties of the nanowhiskers.",
