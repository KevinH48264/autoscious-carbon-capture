        "title": "Renewable-integrated flexible carbon capture: a synergistic path forward to clean energy future",
        "abstract": "To decarbonize electricity grids, CO2 capture and renewable wind/solar are two promising pathways. However, the intermittency of these variable renewable sources and the high energy requirement of carbon capture restrict their widespread deployment. These challenges are traditionally addressed independently at the grid-level, leading to conservative costs and limited operational flexibility for both systems. Here, we examine the synergistic integration of renewables and flexible carbon capture with individual fossil power plants. Renewables provide clean energy for carbon capture, while flexible carbon capture acts as a form of energy storage to counter renewable intermittency. To assess whether the benefits obtained from integration outweigh the capital cost under spatiotemporal variability of electricity markets and renewable energy, we develop a mathematical programming-based optimization framework. We decouple the design and operational decisions in a two-stage optimization strategy to efficiently solve the large-scale problem. When applied to a nationwide case study on coal plants across the US, we observe that, for futuristic carbon tax and renewable cost scenarios, it is profitable to invest in solar-assisted carbon capture for nearly one-third of the coal plants. It reduces carbon capture cost by 8.9%, and accommodates solar intermittency while avoiding the capital cost of an equivalent battery, which is 4.4 times the solar farm cost. Furthermore, the levelized cost of electricity will be less than that of new natural gas plants with overall emission reduction between 87.5 and 91%. The integrated system thereby provides a cost-effective and sustainable measure to reduce CO2 emissions and improve the operational flexibility of existing fossil-based systems for accelerating the clean energy transition of the global energy sector."

        "abstract": "Rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten human society, the natural environment, and the synergy between the two. In order to ameliorate the CO2 problem, carbon capture and conversion techniques have been proposed. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials, a relatively new class of porous materials with unique structural features, high surface areas, chemical tunability and stability, have been extensively studied with respect to their applicability to such techniques. Recently, it has become apparent that the CO2 capture capabilities of MOF-based materials significantly boost their potential toward CO2 conversion. Furthermore, MOF-based materials' well-defined structures greatly facilitate the understanding of structure-property relationships and their roles in CO2 capture and conversion. In this review, we provide a comprehensive account of significant progress in the design and synthesis of MOF-based materials, including MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives, and their application to carbon capture and conversion. Special emphases on the relationships between CO2 capture capacities of MOF-based materials and their catalytic CO2 conversion performances are discussed."

        "abstract": "Significance Carbon dioxide (CO2) drives climate change when released to the atmosphere. Alternatively, CO2 could be captured and utilized as carbon source for chemicals. Here, we provide a global assessment of the technical climate change mitigation potential of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in the chemical industry. We develop an engineering-level model of the global chemical industry representing 75% of current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The model allows us to analyze the potential disruptive changes through large-scale CO2 utilization and resulting emission reductions. Our study shows that CCU has the technical potential to lead to a carbon-neutral chemical industry and decouple chemical production from fossil resources. This transition, however, would cause largely increased mass flows and demand for low-carbon electricity. Chemical production is set to become the single largest driver of global oil consumption by 2030. To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO2-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps. Once and where these other demands are satisfied, CCU in the chemical industry could efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation."

        "title": "Cooperative carbon capture and steam regeneration with tetraamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks",
        "abstract": "Steaming out captured CO2 Although natural gas is less carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2013intensive than coal, capturing its emitted CO2 can be more challenging because combined-cycle natural gas combustion has a CO2 concentration that is only one-third of that of coal combustion and contains high concentrations of oxygen and water. Kim et al. report on a tetraamine-functionalized magnesium metal\u2013organic framework that displays two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption that leads to a high CO2 capacity and adsorption enthalpy (see the Perspective by Peh and Zhao). This material could capture CO2from humid air and could be regenerated with steam, a method that is more economical than temperature or pressure swing methods. Science, this issue p. 392; see also p. 372 Tetraamine-functionalized metal\u2013organic frameworks enable CO2 capture from humid streams, as well as steam regeneration. Natural gas has become the dominant source of electricity in the United States, and technologies capable of efficiently removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the flue emissions of natural gas\u2013fired power plants could reduce their carbon intensity. However, given the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue stream, separation of CO2 is particularly challenging. Taking inspiration from the crystal structures of diamine-appended metal\u2013organic frameworks exhibiting two-step cooperative CO2 adsorption, we report a family of robust tetraamine-functionalized frameworks that retain cooperativity, leading to the potential for exceptional efficiency in capturing CO2 under the extreme conditions relevant to natural gas flue emissions. The ordered, multimetal coordination of the tetraamines imparts the materials with extraordinary stability to adsorption-desorption cycling with simulated humid flue gas and enables regeneration using low-temperature steam in lieu of costly pressure or temperature swings."

        "title": "A Guideline for Life Cycle Assessment of Carbon Capture and Utilization",
        "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) is an emerging field proposed for emissions mitigation and even negative emissions. These potential benefits need to be assessed by the holistic method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that accounts for multiple environmental impact categories over the entire life cycle of products or services. However, even though LCA is a standardized method, current LCA practice differs widely in methodological choices. The resulting LCA studies show large variability which limits their value for decision support. Applying LCA to CCU technologies leads to further specific methodological issues, e.g., due to the double role of CO2 as emission and feedstock. In this work, we therefore present a comprehensive guideline for LCA of CCU technologies. The guideline has been development in a collaborative process involving over 40 experts and builds upon existing LCA standards and guidelines. The presented guidelines should improve comparability of LCA studies through clear methodological guidance and predefined assumptions on feedstock and utilities. Transparency is increased through interpretation and reporting guidance. Improved comparability should help to strengthen knowledge-based decision-making. Consequently, research funds and time can be allocated more efficiently for the development of technologies for climate change mitigation and negative emissions."

        "title": "Carbon Capture From Flue Gas and the Atmosphere: A Perspective",
        "abstract": "Climate change has become a worldwide concern with the rapid rise of the atmospheric Co2 concentration. To mitigate Co2 emissions, the research and development efforts in Co2 capture and separation both from the stationary sources with high Co2 concentrations (e.g., coal-fired power plant flue gas) and directly from the atmosphere have grown significantly. Much progress has been achieved, especially within the last twenty years. In this perspective, we first briefly review the current status of carbon capture technologies including absorption, adsorption, membrane, biological capture, and cryogenic separation, and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Then, we focus mainly on the recent advances in the absorption, adsorption, and membrane technologies. Even though numerous optimizations in materials and processes have been pursued, implementing a single separation process is still quite energy-intensive or costly. To address the challenges, we provide our perspectives on future directions of Co2 capture research and development, that is, the combination of flue gas recycling and hybrid capture system, and one-step integrated Co2 capture and conversion system, as they have the potential to overcome the technical bottlenecks of single capture technologies, offering significant improvement in energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness."

        "title": "Hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane with carbon capture and storage \u2013 A techno-environmental analysis",
        "abstract": "This study presents an integrated techno-environmental assessment of hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane, combined with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). We have included steam methane reforming (SMR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) for syngas production. CO2 is captured from the syngas with a novel vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) process, that combines hydrogen purification and CO2 separation in one cycle. As comparison, we have included cases with conventional amine-based technology. We have extended standard attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) following ISO standards with a detailed carbon balance of the biogas production process (via digestion) and its by-products. The results show that the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of the VPSA and amine-based CO2 capture technologies is very similar as a result of comparable energy consumption. The configuration with the highest plant-wide CO2 capture rate (almost 100% of produced CO2 captured) is autothermal reforming with a two-stage water-gas shift and VPSA CO2 capture \u2013 because the latter has an inherently high CO2 capture rate of 98% or more for the investigated syngas. Depending on the configuration, the addition of CCS to natural gas reforming-based hydrogen production reduces its life-cycle Global Warming Potential by 45\u201385 percent, while the other environmental life-cycle impacts slightly increase. This brings natural gas-based hydrogen on par with renewable electricity-based hydrogen regarding impacts on climate change. When biomethane is used instead of natural gas, our study shows potential for net negative greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. the net removal of CO2 over the life cycle of biowaste-based hydrogen production. In the special case where the biogas digestate is used as agricultural fertiliser, and where a substantial amount of the carbon in the digestate remains in the soil, the biowaste-based hydrogen reaches net-negative life cycle greenhouse gas emissions even without the application of CCS. Addition of CCS to biomethane-based hydrogen production leads to net-negative emissions in all investigated cases."

For adsorption-based gas separations and carbon capture, recent efforts have been directed toward the development of multiscale and performance-based screening workflows where we can go from the atomistic structure of an adsorbent to its equilibrium and transport properties at different scales, and eventually to its separation performance at the process level. The objective of this work is to review the current status of this new approach, discuss its potential and impact on the field of materials screening, and highlight the challenges that limit its application. We compile and introduce all the elements required for the development, implementation, and operation of multiscale workflows, hence providing a useful practical guide and a comprehensive source of reference to the scientific communities who work in this area. Our review includes information about available materials databases, state-of-the-art molecular simulation and process modeling tools, and a complete catalogue of data and parameters that are required at each stage of the multiscale screening. We thoroughly discuss the challenges associated with data availability, consistency of the models, and reproducibility of the data and, finally, propose new directions for the future of the field."

        "abstract": "Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a technology approach to the management of anthropogenic carbon dioxide gas emissions to the atmosphere. By injecting CO2 into host rocks, or by employing a an ex situ application step, geological formations can react with and store huge volumes of CO2 as carbonate minerals. An alternative mineral feedstock material is the Gt of industrial process wastes that are often disposed to landfill. By applying an accelerated carbonation step to solid waste, there is potential to sequestrate meaningful quantities of CO2 in carbonate-cemented products that have reuse potential. The manufacture of carbonated aggregates is commercially established in Europe, and recent advances in technology include a mobile plant that directly utilizes flue-gas derived CO2 in the mineralisation process. The present work discusses the basis for mineralization in geologically derived minerals and industrial wastes, with a focus being on the manufacture of products with value. An assessment of mineralized construction aggregates suggests that carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology can manage significant quantities of this CO2."

In this work, a comparative economic analysis of physical, chemical, and hybrid physical\u2013chemical absorption processes is performed to guide the selection of appropriate carbon capture technologies for different types of CO\u2082 sources. First, three different absorption processes are designed and simulated for treating various industrial CO\u2082-containing gases with distinct pressures and CO\u2082 concentrations. Then, the total annualized costs of the processes are calculated and compared. It is found that for carbon capture at atmospheric pressure, chemical absorption exhibits the highest performance for low CO\u2082 concentrations ( 59.3%). For treating high-pressure CO\u2082-containing gases (e.g., precombustion carbon capture), the hybrid physical\u2013chemical absorption process is economically preferred."

        "abstract": "Today, climate change is assumed by many researchers and scholars as a certainty and is presented as the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. It is commonly accepted that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause that is accelerating the process. Therefore, it is urgent to find solutions to mitigate climate change, mainly because the intense effects have already been felt, in many cases in the form of the occurrence of extremely violent weather events. Forests are undoubtedly one of the most effective and easiest ways to provide the function of carbon sinks. However, it is essential and convenient to analyze the permanence time of this carbon in forests, because this permanence time depends directly on the forest management model used. This article aims to analyze forest management models from the perspective of carbon residence time in temperate forests, dividing the models into three types, namely carbon conservation models, carbon storage models, and carbon substitution models, according to their ability to contribute to functioning as carbon sinks, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change."

        "abstract": "The impending danger of climate change and pollution can now be seen on the world panorama. The concentration of CO2, the most important Green House Gas (GHG), has reached to formidable levels. Although carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods have been largely worked upon, they are cumbersome in terms of economy and their long term environmental safety raises a concern. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis which in turn could be used for the production of bioenergy and other value-added products. Despite enormous potential, the production of microalgae for low-value bulk products and bulk products such as biofuels, is heretofore, not feasible. To achieve economic viability and sustainability, major hurdles in both, the upstream and downstream processes have to be overcome. Recent technoeconomic analyses and life-cycle assessments of microalgae-based production systems have suggested that the only possible way for scaling up the production is to completely use the biomass in an integrated biorefinery set-up wherein every valuable component is extracted, processed and valorized. This article provides a brief yet comprehensive review of the present carbon sequestration and utilization technologies, focusing primarily on biological CO2 capture by microalgae in the context of bio-refinery. The paper discusses various products of microalgal biorefinery and aims to assess the opportunities, challenges and current state-of-the-art of microalgae-based CO2 bioconversion, which are essential to the sustainability of this approach in terms of the environment as well as the economy."

Here, we review the leading CO2 capture technologies, available in the short and long term, and their technological maturity, before discussing CO2 transport and storage. Current pilot plants and demonstrations are highlighted, as is the importance of optimising the CCS system as a whole. Other topics briefly discussed include the viability of both the capture of CO2 from the air and CO2 reutilisation as climate change mitigation strategies.

        "abstract": "How will the global atmosphere and climate be protected? Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2\u00b0C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2\u2009yr\u22121, not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2\u2009yr\u22121 required to meet the 2\u00b0C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2\u00b0C.

ZIF\u20108, one of the most popular MOFs, has a crystallographically determined pore aperture of 0.34 nm, ideal for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation; however, its flexible lattice restricts the corresponding separation selectivities to below 5. A novel postsynthetic rapid heat treatment (RHT), implemented in a few seconds at 360 \u00b0C, which drastically improves the carbon capture performance of the ZIF\u20108 membranes, is reported. Lattice stiffening is confirmed by the appearance of a temperature\u2010activated transport, attributed to a stronger interaction of gas molecules with the pore aperture, with activation energy increasing with the molecular size (CH4 > CO2 > H2). Unprecedented CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and H2/CH4 selectivities exceeding 30, 30, and 175, respectively, and complete blockage of C3H6, are achieved. Spectroscopic and X\u2010ray diffraction studies confirm that while the coordination environment and crystallinity are unaffected, lattice distortion and strain are incorporated in the ZIF\u20108 lattice, increasing the lattice stiffness. Overall, RHT treatment is a facile and versatile technique that can vastly improve the gas\u2010separation performance of the MOF membranes."

The effective adsorption of CO2 gas (\u224812 mol kg\u22121) on individual sheets of 2D transition metal carbides (referred to as MXenes) is reported here. It is shown that exposure to N2 gas results in no adsorption, consistent with first\u2010principles calculations.

Our modeling framework evaluates least cost source\u2013sink relationships and aggregation opportunities for pipeline transport, which can cost-effectively transport small CO2 volumes to suitable sequestration sites; 216 existing US biorefineries emit 45 Mt CO2 annually from fermentation, of which 60% could be captured and compressed for pipeline transport for under $25/tCO2. A sequestration credit, analogous to existing CCS tax credits, of $60/tCO2 could incent 30 Mt of sequestration and 6,900 km of pipeline infrastructure across the United States. Similarly, a carbon abatement credit, analogous to existing tradeable CO2 credits, of $90/tCO2 can incent 38 Mt of abatement. Aggregation of CO2 sources enables cost-effective long-distance pipeline transport to distant sequestration sites. Financial incentives under the low-carbon fuel standard in California and recent revisions to existing federal tax credits suggest a substantial near-term opportunity to permanently sequester biogenic CO2. This financial opportunity could catalyze the growth of carbon capture, transport, and sequestration; improve the lifecycle impacts of conventional biofuels; support development of carbon-negative fuels; and help fulfill the mandates of low-carbon fuel policies across the United States."

        "abstract": "Description A hydrophobic CO2 physisorbent Most materials for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture of fossil fuel combustion, such as amines, rely on strong chemisorption interactions that are highly selective but can incur a large energy penalty to release CO2. Lin et al. show that a zinc-based metal organic framework material can physisorb CO2 and incurs a lower regeneration penalty. Its binding site at the center of the pores precludes the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks between water molecules. This durable material can preferentially adsorb CO2 at 40% relative humidity and maintains its performance under flue gas conditions of 150\u00b0C. \u2014PDS A metal-organic framework captures CO2 with high capacity and selectivity over steam with only a modest regeneration penalty. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid sorbents for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture face the challenge of merging efficient capture with economical regeneration in a durable, scalable material. Zinc-based Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20) physisorbs CO2 with high capacity but is also selective over water. Competitive separations on structured CALF-20 show not just preferential CO2 physisorption below 40% relative humidity but also suppression of water sorption by CO2, which was corroborated by computational modeling. CALF-20 has a low enthalpic regeneration penalty and shows durability to steam (>450,000 cycles) and wet acid gases. It can be prepared in one step, formed as composite materials, and its synthesis can be scaled to multikilogram batches."

        "abstract": "Climate change due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (e.g., combustion of fossil fuels) represents one of the most profound environmental disasters of this century. Equipping power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has the potential to reduce current worldwide CO2 emissions. However, existing CCS schemes (i.e., amine scrubbing) are highly energy-intensive. The urgent abatement of CO2 emissions relies on the development of new, efficient technologies to capture CO2 from existing power plants. Membrane-based CO2 separation is an attractive technology that meets many of the requirements for energy-efficient industrial carbon capture. Within this domain, thin-film composite (TFC) membranes are particularly attractive, providing high gas permeance in comparison with conventional thicker (\u223c50 \u03bcm) dense membranes. TFC membranes are usually composed of three layers: (1) a bottom porous support layer; (2) a highly permeable intermediate gutter layer; and (3) a thin (<1 \u03bcm) species-selective top layer. A key challenge in the development of TFC membranes has been to simultaneously maximize the transmembrane gas permeance of the assembled membrane (by minimizing the gas resistance of each layer) while maintaining high gas-specific selectivity. In this Account, we provide an overview of our recent development of high-performance TFC membrane materials as well as insights into the unique fabrication strategies employed for the selective layer and gutter layer. Optimization of each layer of the membrane assembly individually results in significant improvements in overall membrane performance. First, incorporating nanosized fillers into the selective layer (poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymers) and reducing its thickness (to ca. 50 nm) through continuous assembly of polymers technology yields\u00a0major improvements in CO2 permeance without loss of selectivity. Second, we focus on optimization of the middle gutter layer of TFC membranes. The development of enhanced gutter layers employing two- and three-dimensional metal-organic framework materials leads to considerable improvements in both CO2 permeance and selectivity compared with traditional poly(dimethylsiloxane) materials. Third, incorporation of a porous, flexible support layer culminates in a mechanically robust high-performance TFC membrane design that exhibits unprecedented CO2 separation performance and holds significant potential for industrial CO2 capture. Alternative strategies are also emerging, whereby the selective layer and gutter layer may be combined for enhanced membrane efficiency. This Account highlights the CO2 capture performance, current challenges, and future research directions in designing high-performance TFC membranes."

        "title": "Pyrogenic carbon capture and storage",
        "abstract": "The growth of biomass is considered the most efficient method currently available to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, biomass carbon is easily degraded by microorganisms releasing it in the form of greenhouse gases back to the atmosphere. If biomass is pyrolyzed, the organic carbon is converted into solid (biochar), liquid (bio\u2010oil), and gaseous (permanent pyrogas) carbonaceous products. During the last decade, biochar has been discussed as a promising option to improve soil fertility and sequester carbon, although the carbon efficiency of the thermal conversion of biomass into biochar is in the range of 30%\u201350% only. So far, the liquid and gaseous pyrolysis products were mainly considered for combustion, though they can equally be processed into recalcitrant forms suitable for carbon sequestration. In this review, we show that pyrolytic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) can aspire for carbon sequestration efficiencies of >70%, which is shown to be an important threshold to allow PyCCS to become a relevant negative emission technology. Prolonged residence times of pyrogenic carbon can be generated (a) within the terrestrial biosphere including the agricultural use of biochar; (b) within advanced bio\u2010based materials as long as they are not oxidized (biochar, bio\u2010oil); and (c) within suitable geological deposits (bio\u2010oil and CO2 from permanent pyrogas oxidation). While pathway (c) would need major carbon taxes or similar governmental incentives to become a realistic option, pathways (a) and (b) create added economic value and could at least partly be implemented without other financial incentives. Pyrolysis technology is already well established, biochar sequestration and bio\u2010oil sequestration in soils, respectively biomaterials, do not present ecological hazards, and global scale\u2010up appears feasible within a time frame of 10\u201330 years. Thus, PyCCS could evolve into a decisive tool for global carbon governance, serving climate change mitigation and the sustainable development goals simultaneously."

        "abstract": "Significance Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a crucial technology needed to limit warming to the 2 \u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement. However, deployment is lagging far behind estimates of what is required. We demonstrate an opportunity to significantly expand CCUS in the United States in the near-term, spurred by new financial incentives enacted in February 2018, by targeting the lowest-cost capture opportunities and by deploying only commercially proven technologies. The carbon dioxide pipeline transport network would serve near-term oil industry demand for carbon dioxide while also connecting multiple prospective long-term dedicated geological storage resources. This would be a flexible long-term infrastructure asset for carbon management in the United States that would enable and accelerate future CCUS deployment. In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States\u2019 carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented. This represents an opportunity to considerably increase CCUS in the near-term and develop long-term transport infrastructure facilitating future growth."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Climate engineering (CE) and carbon capture and storage are controversial options for addressing climate change. This study compares public perception in Germany of three specific measures: solar radiation management (SRM) via stratospheric sulphate injection, large-scale afforestation, and carbon capture and storage sub-seabed (CCS-S). In a survey experiment we find that afforestation is most readily accepted as a measure for addressing climate change, followed by CCS-S and lastly SRM, which is widely rejected. Providing additional information decreases acceptance for all measures, but their ranking remains unchanged. The acceptance of all three measures is especially influenced by the perceived seriousness of climate change and by trust in institutions. Also, respondents dislike the measures more if they perceive them as a way of shirking responsibility for emissions or as an unconscionable manipulation of nature. Women react more negatively to information than men, whereas the level of education or the degree of intuitive vs reflective decision making does not influence the reaction to information. POLICY RELEVANCE Current projections suggest that the use of climate engineering (CE) technologies or carbon capture and storage (CCS) is necessary if global warming is to be kept well below 2\u00b0C. Our article focuses on the perspective of the general public and thus supplements the dialogue between policymakers, interest groups, and scientists on how to address climate change. We show that in Germany public acceptance of potentially effective measures such as SRM or CCS-S is low and decreases even more when additional information is provided. This implies that lack of public acceptance may turn out to be a bottleneck for future implementation. Ongoing research and development in connection with CCS-S and SRM requires continuous communication with, and involvement of, the public in order to obtain feedback and assess the public\u2019s reservations about the measures. The low level of acceptance also implies that emission reduction should remain a priority in climate policy."

        "abstract": "Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is heavily relied upon in scenarios of future emissions that are consistent with limiting global mean temperature increase to 1.5\u2009\u00b0C or 2\u2009\u00b0C above pre-industrial. These temperature limits are defined in the Paris Agreement in order to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Here, we explore the use of BECCS technologies in a reference scenario and three low emission scenarios generated by an integrated assessment model (IMAGE). Using these scenarios we investigate the feasibility of key implicit and explicit assumptions about these BECCS technologies, including biomass resource, land use, CO2 storage capacity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment rate. In these scenarios, we find that half of all global CO2 storage required by 2100 occurs in USA, Western Europe, China and India, which is compatible with current estimates of regional CO2 storage capacity. CCS deployment rates in the scenarios are very challenging compared to historical rates of fossil, renewable or nuclear technologies and are entirely dependent on stringent policy action to incentivise CCS. In the scenarios, half of the biomass resource is derived from agricultural and forestry residues and half from dedicated bioenergy crops grown on abandoned agricultural land and expansion into grasslands (i.e. land for forests and food production is protected). Poor governance of the sustainability of bioenergy crop production can significantly limit the amount of CO2 removed by BECCS, through soil carbon loss from direct and indirect land use change. Only one-third of the bioenergy crops are grown in regions associated with more developed governance frameworks. Overall, the scenarios in IMAGE are ambitious but consistent with current relevant literature with respect to assumed biomass resource, land use and CO2 storage capacity."

Unlike the power generation sector, three calculation methods are often used to evaluate the CO2 avoidance cost in the case of CCS from industrial sources. However, each of these methods relies on different assumptions of which potential users are not always aware. The links between these three methods are here presented and verified over an illustrative case to highlight the conditions that are required to ensure their reliable use, as well as their associated shortcomings. Finally, the basis to ensure the selection of the CO2 avoidance cost calculation method that is both valid and most efficient for cases considered by potential users are presented.

        "abstract": "In recent years, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has been proposed as a potential technological solution to the problems of greenhouse-gas emissions and the ever-growing energy demand. To combat climate change and ocean acidification as a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, efforts have already been put forth to capture and sequester CO2 from large point sources, especially power plants; however, the utilization of CO2 as a feedstock to make valuable chemicals, materials, and transportation fuels is potentially more desirable and provides a better and long-term solution than sequestration. The products of CO2 utilization can supplement or replace chemical feedstocks in the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, and polymer industries. In this review, we first provide an overview of the current status of CO2-capture technologies and their associated challenges and opportunities with respect to efficiency and economy followed by an overview of various carbon-utilization approaches. The current status of combined CO2 capture and utilization, as a novel efficient and cost-effective approach, is also briefly discussed. We summarize the main challenges associated with the design, development, and large-scale deployment of CO2 capture and utilization processes to provide a perspective and roadmap for the development of new technologies and opportunities to accelerate their scale-up in the near future."

        "abstract": "Ulva species have been considered as ideal candidates for carbon capture, bioremediation and biofuel production. However, little is known regarding the effects of simultaneous ocean warming, acidification and eutrophication on these capacities. In this study, Ulva rigida was cultivated under two levels of: temperature (14 \u00b0C (LT) and 18 \u00b0C (HT)); pH (8.10 and 7.70) by controlling pCO2 (LC, HC respectively); and nutrients (low (LN) \u2013 50 \u03bcm N and 2.5 \u03bcm P and high (HN) \u2013 1000 \u03bcm N and 50 \u03bcm P) for 6 weeks. During the first week of cultivation, HT, HC and HN increased biomass by 38.1%, 17.1% and 20.8%, respectively, while the higher temperature led to negative growth in weeks 2, 4 and 6 due to reproductive events. By the end of the cultivation, biomass under HTHCHN was 130.4% higher than the control (LTLCLN), contributing to a higher carbon capture capacity. Although the thalli at HT released nutrients to seawater in weeks 2, 4 and 6, the HTHCHN treatment increased the overall nitrate uptake rate over the cultivation period by 489.0%. The HTHCHN treatment also had an increased biochemical methane potential and methane yield (47.3% and 254.6%, respectively). Our findings demonstrate that the capacities for carbon and nutrient capture, and biomethane production of U. rigida in the future ocean may be enhanced, providing important insight into the interactions between global change and seaweeds."

Furthermore, only low-coordinate corner/edge sites on the thermodynamically stable (100) facet display favorable binding toward CO2, providing inherently low capacity. The (111) facet, however, exhibits a high concentration of low-coordinate sites. In this work, MgO(111) nanosheets displayed high capacity for CO2, as well as a \u223c65% increase in capacity despite a \u223c30% reduction in surface area following sintering (0.77 mmol g-1 @ 227 m2 g-1 vs 1.28 mmol g-1 @ 154 m2 g-1). These results, unique to MgO(111), suggest intrinsic differences in the effects of sintering on basic site retention. Spectroscopic and computational investigations provided a new structure-activity insight: the importance of high-temperature activation to unleash the capacity of the polar (111) facet of MgO. In summary, we present the first example of a faceted sorbent for carbon capture and challenge the assumption that sintering is necessarily a negative process; here we leverage high-temperature conditions for facet-dependent surface activation."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Studies show that the \u2018well below 2\u00b0C\u2019 target from the Paris Agreement will be hard to meet without large negative emissions from mid-century onwards, which means removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing the carbon dioxide in biomass, soil, suitable geological formations, deep ocean sediments, or chemically bound to certain minerals. Biomass energy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is the negative emission technology (NET) given most attention in a number of integrated assessment model studies and in the latest IPCC reports. However, less attention has been given to governance aspects of NETs. This study aims to identify pragmatic ways forward for BECCS, through synthesizing the literature relevant to accounting and rewarding BECCS, and its relation to the Paris Agreement. BECCS is divided into its two elements: biomass and CCS. Calculating net negative emissions requires accounting for sustainability and resource use related to biomass energy production, processing and use, and interactions with the global carbon cycle. Accounting for the CCS element of BECCS foremost relates to the carbon dioxide capture rate and safe underground storage. Rewarding BECCS as a NET depends on the efficiency of biomass production, transport and processing for energy use, global carbon cycle feedbacks, and safe storage of carbon dioxide, which together determine net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Sustainable biomass production is essential, especially with regard to trade-offs with competing land use. Negative emissions have an added value compared to avoided emissions, which should be reflected in the price of negative emission \u2018credits\u2019, but must be discounted due to global carbon cycle feedbacks. BECCS development will depend on linkages to carbon trading mechanisms and biomass trading. Key policy insights A standardized framework for sustainable biomass should be adopted. Countries should agree on a standardized framework for accounting and rewarding BECCS and other negative emission technologies. Early government support is indispensable to enable BECCS development, scale-up and business engagement. BECCS projects should be designed to maximize learning across various applications and across other NETs. BECCS development should be aligned with modalities of the Paris Agreement and market mechanisms."

        "abstract": "Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but concerns remain about competition for arable land and freshwater. The synergistic integration of algae production, which does not require arable land or freshwater, with BECCS (called \u201cABECCS\u201d) can reduce CO2 emissions without competing with agriculture. This study presents a technoeconomic and life\u2010cycle assessment for colocating a 121\u2010ha algae facility with a 2,680\u2010ha eucalyptus forest for BECCS. The eucalyptus biomass fuels combined heat and power (CHP) generation with subsequent amine\u2010based carbon capture and storage (CCS). A portion of the captured CO2 is used for growing algae and the remainder is sequestered. Biomass combustion supplies CO2, heat, and electricity, thus increasing the range of sites suitable for algae cultivation. Economic, energetic, and environmental impacts are considered. The system yields as much protein as soybeans while generating 61.5 TJ of electricity and sequestering 29,600\u2009t of CO2 per year. More energy is generated than consumed and the freshwater footprint is roughly equal to that for soybeans. Financial break\u2010even is achieved for product value combinations that include 1) algal biomass sold for $1,400/t (fishmeal replacement) with a $68/t carbon credit and 2) algal biomass sold for $600/t (soymeal replacement) with a $278/t carbon credit. Sensitivity analysis shows significant reductions to the cost of carbon sequestration are possible. The ABECCS system represents a unique technology for negative emissions without reducing protein production or increasing water demand, and should therefore be included in the suite of technologies being considered to address global sustainability."

CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) has received tremendous attention due to its significant role in intensifying global warming. Considering the lack of a timely review on the state-of-the-art progress of promising CCU techniques, developing an appropriate and prompt summary of such advanced techniques with a comprehensive understanding is necessary. Thus, it is imperative to provide a timely review, given the fast growth of sophisticated CO2 capture and utilization materials and their implementation. In this work, we critically summarized and comprehensively reviewed the characteristics and performance of both liquid and solid CO2 adsorbents with possible schemes for the improvement of their CO2 capture ability and advances in CO2 utilization. Their industrial applications in pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture as well as utilization were systematically discussed and compared. With our great effort, this review would be of significant importance for academic researchers for obtaining an overall understanding of the current developments and future trends of CCU. This work is bound to benefit researchers in fields relating to CCU and facilitate the progress of significant breakthroughs in both fundamental research and commercial applications to deliver perspective views for future scientific and industrial advances in CCU."

Processes for direct capture of CO2 from the air are also under development and are starting to be tested at pilot scale. Transportation of CO2 to storage sites by pipeline is well-established, though substantially more pipeline capacity will be required if CCUS is to be undertaken at a large scale. Considerable experience has now been built up in enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) operations, which have been under way since the 1970s. Storage in deep saline aquifers has also been achieved at scale. Recent large-scale projects that capture and store CO2 are described, as are current and potential future markets for CO2. Potential effects of changes in the US tax code Section 45Q on those markets are summarized. Future deployment of CCUS will depend more on cost reductions for CO2 separations, development of new markets for CO2, and the complexities of project finance than on technical issues associated with storage of CO2 in the subsurface."

In subsequent sections, early laboratory and field corrosion experience relating to natural dense-phase CO2 transport for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are summarised along with more recent research efforts which focus on identifying the role of anthropogenic impurities in the degradation processes. For each system impurity, the reaction rates, mechanisms and corrosion product composition/morphology expected at the steel surfaces are discussed, as well as each component\u2019s ability to influence the critical water content required to initiate corrosion. Potential bulk phase reactions between multiple impurities are also evaluated in an attempt to help understand how the impurity content may evolve along a long-distance pipeline. The likelihood of stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking is discussed and the various corrosion mitigation techniques which exist to control degradation to acceptable levels are reviewed. Based on the current research performed in the context of impure dense-phase CO2 corrosion, issues associated with performing laboratory experiments to replicate field conditions and the challenges such limitations present in terms of defining the safe operating window for CO2 transport are considered."

        "title": "Influence of Pyrolysis Temperature on Physico-Chemical Properties of Corn Stover (Zea mays L.) Biochar and Feasibility for Carbon Capture and Energy Balance",
        "abstract": "This study examined the influence of pyrolysis temperature on biochar characteristics and evaluated its suitability for carbon capture and energy production. Biochar was produced from corn stover using slow pyrolysis at 300, 400 and 500\u00b0C and 2 hrs holding time. The experimental biochars were characterized by elemental analysis, BET, FTIR, TGA/DTA, NMR (C-13). Higher heating value (HHV) of feedstock and biochars was measured using bomb calorimeter. Results show that carbon content of corn stover biochar increased from 45.5% to 64.5%, with increasing pyrolysis temperatures. A decrease in H:C and O:C ratios as well as volatile matter, coupled with increase in the concentration of aromatic carbon in the biochar as determined by FTIR and NMR (C-13) demonstrates a higher biochar carbon stability at 500\u00b0C. It was estimated that corn stover pyrolysed at 500\u00b0C could provide of 10.12 MJ/kg thermal energy. Pyrolysis is therefore a potential technology with its carbon-negative, energy positive and soil amendment benefits thus creating win- win scenario."

        "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), by virtue of their remarkable uptake capability, selectivity, and ease of regeneration, hold great promise for carbon capture from fossil fuel combustion. However, their stability toward moisture together with the competitive adsorption of water against CO2 drastically dampens their capacity and selectivity under real humid flue gas conditions. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to tackle the above obstacles by partitioning the channels of MOFs into confined, hydrophobic compartments by in situ polymerization of aromatic acetylenes. Specifically, polynaphthylene was formed via a radical reaction inside the channels of MOF-5 and served as partitions without altering the underlying structure of the framework. Compared with pristine MOF-5, the resultant material (PN@MOF-5) exhibits a doubled CO2 capacity (78 vs 38 cm(3)/g at 273 K and 1 bar), 23 times higher CO2/N2 selectivity (212 vs 9), and significantly improved moisture stability. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity can be largely maintained (>90%) under humid conditions during cycles. This strategy can be applied to other MOF materials and may shed light on the design of new MOF-polymer materials with tunable pore sizes and environments to promote their practical applications."

        "abstract": "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is considered a potential source of net negative carbon emissions and, if deployed at sufficient scale, could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and concentrations. However, the viability and economic consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment are not fully understood. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) integrated assessment model to explore the potential global and regional economic impacts of BECCS. As a negative-emissions technology, BECCS would entail a net subsidy in a policy environment in which carbon emissions are taxed. We show that by mid-century, in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 \u00b0C, carbon tax revenues have peaked and are rapidly approaching the point where climate mitigation is a net burden on general tax revenues. Assuming that the required policy instruments are available to support BECCS deployment, we consider its effects on global trade patterns of fossil fuels, biomass, and agricultural products. We find that in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 \u00b0C, the absence of CCS harms fossil-fuel exporting regions, while the presence of CCS, and BECCS in particular, allows greater continued use and export of fossil fuels. We also explore the relationship between carbon prices, food-crop prices and use of BECCS. We show that the carbon price and biomass and food crop prices are directly related. We also show that BECCS reduces the upward pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. All of this notwithstanding, many challenges, both technical and institutional, remain to be addressed before BECCS can be deployed at scale."

        "abstract": "The development of practical solutions for the energy\u2010efficient capture of carbon dioxide is of prime importance and continues to attract intensive research interest. Conceivably, the implementation of adsorption\u2010based processes using different cycling modes, e.g., pressure\u2010swing adsorption or temperature\u2010swing adsorption, offers great prospects to address this challenge. Practically, the successful deployment of practical adsorption\u2010based technologies depends on the development of made\u2010to\u2010order adsorbents expressing mutually two compulsory requisites: i) high selectivity/affinity for CO2 and ii) excellent chemical stability in the presence of impurities. This study presents a new comprehensive experimental protocol apposite for assessing the prospects of a given physical adsorbent for carbon capture under flue gas stream conditions. The protocol permits: i) the baseline performance of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite 13X, activated carbon versus liquid amine scrubbing to be ascertained, and ii) a standardized evaluation of the best reported metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials for carbon dioxide capture from flue gas to be undertaken. This extensive study corroborates the exceptional CO2 capture performance of the recently isolated second\u2010generation fluorinated MOF material, NbOFFIVE\u20101\u2010Ni, concomitant with an impressive chemical stability and a low energy for regeneration. Essentially, the NbOFFIVE\u20101\u2010Ni adsorbent presents the best compromise by satisfying all the required metrics for efficient CO2 scrubbing."

        "title": "The progressive routes for carbon capture and sequestration",
        "abstract": "The global warming is directly related to the increased greenhouse gas emissions from both natural and anthropogenic origins. There has been a drastic rise in the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution primarily due to the intensifying consumption of fossil fuels. With the need to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate global warming certain strategies relating to carbon capturing and sequestration are indispensable. This paper comprehensively describes several physicochemical, biological and geological routes for carbon capture and sequestration. The trend of the increase in greenhouse gases over the years is illustrated along with the global statistics for fossil fuels usage and biofuels production. The physicochemical carbon capturing technologies discussed include absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic distillation. The algal and bacterial systems, dedicated energy crops and coalbed methanogenesis have been vividly explained as the biological routes for carbon sequestration. The geological carbon sequestering route centers on biochar application and oceanic carbon storage. A systematic survey has been made on the origin and impact of greenhouse gases along with the potential for sequestration based on some fast\u2010track and long\u2010term sequestration technologies."

        "abstract": "Development of novel technologies for the efficient and reversible capture of CO2 is highly desired. In the last decade, CO2 capture using ionic liquids has attracted intensive attention from both academia and industry, and has been recognized as a very promising technology. Recently, a new approach has been developed for highly efficient capture of CO2 by site-containing ionic liquids through chemical interaction. This perspective review focuses on the recent advances in the chemical absorption of CO2 using site-containing ionic liquids, such as amino-based ionic liquids, azolate ionic liquids, phenolate ionic liquids, dual-functionalized ionic liquids, pyridine-containing ionic liquids and so on. Other site-containing liquid absorbents such as amine-based solutions, switchable solvents, and functionalized ionic liquid-amine blends are also investigated. Strategies have been discussed for how to activate the existent reactive sites and develop novel reactive sites by physical and chemical methods to enhance CO2 absorption capacity and reduce absorption enthalpy. The carbon capture mechanisms of these site-containing liquid absorbents are also presented. Particular attention has been paid to the latest progress in CO2 capture in multiple-site interactions by amino-free anion-functionalized ionic liquids. In the last section, future directions and prospects for carbon capture by site-containing ionic liquids are outlined."

        "abstract": "Several different carbon-capture technologies have been proposed for use in the cement industry. This paper reviews their attributes, the progress that has been made toward their commercialization, and the major challenges facing their retrofitting to existing cement plants. A technology readiness level (TRL) scale for carbon capture in the cement industry is developed. For application at cement plants, partial oxy-fuel combustion, amine scrubbing, and calcium looping are the most developed (TRL 6 being the pilot system demonstrated in relevant environment), followed by direct capture (TRL 4-5 being the component and system validation at lab-scale in a relevant environment) and full oxy-fuel combustion (TRL 4 being the component and system validation at lab-scale in a lab environment). Our review suggests that advancing to TRL 7 (demonstration in plant environment) seems to be a challenge for the industry, representing a major step up from TRL 6. The important attributes that a cement plant must have to be \"carbon-capture ready\" for each capture technology selection is evaluated. Common requirements are space around the preheater and precalciner section, access to CO2 transport infrastructure, and a retrofittable preheater tower. Evidence from the electricity generation sector suggests that carbon capture readiness is not always cost-effective. The similar durations of cement-plant renovation and capture-plant construction suggests that synchronizing these two actions may save considerable time and money."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas pollutant and fossil fuel-fired electrical power plants are the major producer of CO2. In this regard, it is required to equip the electrical power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems. This paper addresses a multistage generation expansion planning (GEP) including nuclear units, renewable energy units, and different fossil fuel-fired units equipped with CCS. The proposed GEP minimizes the planning costs and CO2 at the same time, while it considers CCS cost and revenue. The problem is mathematically expressed as a constrained, mixed-integer, and nonlinear optimization problem and solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The problem considers all practical constraints including security constraints of the network, and the generating units constraints of operation. Simulation results demonstrate that utilizing CCS significantly impacts on the planning output. Eventually, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the CCS cost and revenue."

        "abstract": "The fabrication and manufacturing processes of industrial commodities such as iron, glass, and cement are carbon-intensive, accounting for 23% of global CO2 emissions. As a climate mitigation strategy, CO2 capture from flue gases of industrial processes-much like that of the power sector-has not experienced wide adoption given its high associated costs. However, some industrial processes with relatively high CO2 flue concentration may be viable candidates to cost-competitively supply CO2 for utilization purposes (e.g., polymer manufacturing, etc.). This work develops a methodology that determines the levelized cost ($/tCO2) of separating, compressing, and transporting carbon dioxide. A top-down model determines the cost of separating and compressing CO2 across 18 industrial processes. Further, the study calculates the cost of transporting CO2 via pipeline and tanker truck to appropriately paired sinks using a bottom-up cost model and geo-referencing approach. The results show that truck transportation is generally the low-cost alternative given the relatively small volumes (ca. 100 kt CO2/a). We apply our methodology to a regional case study in Pennsylvania, which shows steel and cement manufacturing paired to suitable sinks as having the lowest levelized cost of capture, compression, and transportation."

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the modeling and analysis of a carbon capture technology-based resource scheduling/unit commitment (UC) methodology in carbon/emission-constrained environment. In carbon markets, the overall generation from conventional/fossil-fueled thermal plants is constrained over the total cost which is the sum of generation, capture cost/emission avoidance cost. Therefore, in this paper, generalized/uniform performance indices affecting the UC schedule are derived. Also, a commitment/scheduling methodology based on capture and fuel cost is devised rather than the existing penalty cost methodology as in the modernized markets everything was dealt in monetary value. Furthermore, the impact of type of resource used, i.e., coal rank is also considered to evaluate the sensitivity of scheduling decisions and financial influence of carbon capture technology. Along with performance indices, correction factors are also proposed to justify the effect of resource/coal rank in the process of optimal generation allocation. The effect of correction factors and type of coal is observed to be predominant at lower capture efficiencies compared to higher capture efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method over the penalty method is reflected in reduced generation cost and emission avoidance cost when compared to the penalty-based methodology."

        "abstract": "Carbon capture using various technical options, viz., adsorption, absorption, chemical looping combustion, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation in either pre- or post=combustion modes, has been found to be the effective solution to tackle a serious concern of global warming. Although adsorption has been widely employed in carbon capture as a result of its economically and environmentally benign nature, it could not be commercialized as a result of the highly energy-intensive regeneration process involved. The major challenge in carbon capture is its sustainability at a high temperature, therefore enabling an easy integration with power generation to make it commercially viable, and also in the production of hydrogen using sorption-enhanced steam reforming. In this work, various combinations of sorbents based on CaO, MgO, zeolites H-Beta and H-ZSM 5, and Al2O3 with and without doping of coal fly ash (C and F types) have been employed in carbon capture using a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor system.

One potential technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is the integrated bioenergy production and carbon capture system.

Meanwhile, CO2 produced from bioenergy production is separated for other purposes through carbon capture. To ensure the entire system is environmental friendly, an efficient and green carbon capture solvent should be utilized. Ionic liquids (ILs) are the potential solvents for this purpose, as they have negligible vapor pressure and high thermal stability. However, there are up to a million possible combinations of cations and anions that may make up ILs. This work presents a systematic approach to identify an optimal IL solvent to separate CO2 produced from a bioenergy system at the optimal conditions of carbon capture process.

        "abstract": "Despite the large number of metal-organic frameworks that have been studied in the context of post-combustion carbon capture, adsorption equilibria of gas mixtures including CO2, N2, and H2O, which are the three biggest components of the flue gas emanating from a coal- or natural gas-fired power plant, have never been reported. Here, we disclose the design and validation of a high-throughput multicomponent adsorption instrument that can measure equilibrium adsorption isotherms for mixtures of gases at conditions that are representative of an actual flue gas from a power plant. This instrument is used to study 15 different metal-organic frameworks, zeolites, mesoporous silicas, and activated carbons representative of the broad range of solid adsorbents that have received attention for CO2 capture. While the multicomponent results presented in this work provide many interesting fundamental insights, only adsorbents functionalized with alkylamines are shown to have any significant CO2 capacity in the presence of N2 and H2O at equilibrium partial pressures similar to those expected in a carbon capture process. Most significantly, the amine-appended metal organic framework mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) (mmen = N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine, dobpdc (4-) = 4,4'-dioxido-3,3'-biphenyldicarboxylate) exhibits a record CO2 capacity of 4.2 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/g (16 wt %) at 0.1 bar and 40 \u00b0C in the presence of a high partial pressure of H2O."
