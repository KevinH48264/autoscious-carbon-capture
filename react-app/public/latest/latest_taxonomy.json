                                        "abstract": "Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a relatively new method to produce hydrogen (H2) and is also used as an energy conversion method for solid, liquid or gaseous fuels. There are various advantages of this method such as inherent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, minimal NOx emissions and the H2 production. In this process, there is no direct contact between the fuel and oxidizer. This method utilizes oxygen from an oxygen carrier which may be a transition metal. The idea is to split the combustion process into three separate sub-processes by employing three separate reactors: air reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized by air, fuel reactor where natural gas is oxidized to produce a stream of CO2 and H2O and steam reactor where the steam is reduced to produce H2. In this study, a thermodynamic model with iron oxides as oxygen carrier has been developed using Aspen Plus by employing conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLR system. The developed model was employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters such as mass flow rates of air, fuel, steam and oxygen carrier and fraction of inert material on H2 and CO2 production and key reactor temperatures. The results show that the H2 production increases with the increase in air, fuel and steam flow rates up to a certain limit and stays constant for higher flow rates. The CO2 production follows a similar trend. Similarly, the H2 production also increases with the increase in oxide flow rate and fraction of inert material up to a particular value, but then decrease for higher oxide flow rates and inert fractions. Reactor temperatures were also observed in this study. The temperatures increase with the increase of steam and air flow rates till the stoichiometric values and decrease thereafter. Increase in the fuel flow rate shows a decreasing trend in all the reactor temperatures. The reactor temperatures increase with the increase in oxide flow rates and the decrease of the inert mass fraction. The data obtained from the simulations is also used for exergetic analysis of the system. The overall exergetic efficiency was found to decrease with steam, air and oxide flow rates and increase with the increase in the fuel flow rate and the fraction of inert material.",

                                "abstract": "Microporous carbons were developed for CO2 capture from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) via a simple carbonization method. The carbonization was carried out in the temperature range of 400\u2013800 \u00b0C, and the effects of the carbonization temperature on the characteristics and CO2 adsorption behavior of the prepared carbon materials were investigated by both experiments and density functional theory studies. The textural characteristics of the carbon materials were highly dependent on the carbonization temperature, and narrow micropores (<0.7 nm) were predominantly generated from the decomposition of PVDF giving off fluorine during carbonization. The specific surface area and pore volume increased up to 1011 m2 g\u22121 and 0.416 cm3 g\u22121, respectively, and the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.59 mol kg\u22121 was obtained at 25 \u00b0C and \u223c1 bar in PVDF carbonized at 800 \u00b0C. The carbonized PVDFs also exhibited highly stable CO2 adsorption uptake and rapid kinetics through repeated adsorption\u2013desorption cycles, showing that carbonized PVDFs are promising adsorbents for CO2 capture. The density functional theory calculation suggested that stable configuration with favorable adsorption energy can be introduced by the removal of fluorine from PVDF, which results in the reduction of repulsive interactions between electronegative fluorine in PVDF and oxygen in CO2 molecule.",

In this work, a model based approach is used to investigate the technical, operational and control aspects of the solar thermal installation of the super structure (power plant + PCC + solar thermal plant). The base case is a 660 MWe PCC-retrofitted power plant operating at 100% capacity and 90% capture rate in Australia. This is repowered by a solar thermal plant consisting of (a) a parabolic trough solar collector field with 806,520 m2 aperture area, (b) a thermal storage system with 8 full load hours of thermal storage and (c) an auxiliary gas heating unit, ensuring the solar thermal plant provides the high pressure side feed water preheating duty at all times without requirement to withdraw any steam from the power plant turbine circuit. A total of 230 MWth is provided from the solar thermal plant installation, being 100% supply for high pressure and intermediate feed water preheaters duty plus a surplus of 30% for maintaining the deaerator operation. A key feature here is trying to eliminate the frequent changes to the steam flow rate in the turbine circuit for solar feed water preheating and thus promoting ease of retrofit of repowering technology to PCC-retrofitted power plants. Details of the component sizing and modelling of solar thermal installation are provided and control and operating schemes are identified and analysed. A comprehensive dynamic model in TRNSYS dynamic modelling software is developed and used to analyse the solar thermal plant dynamic responses to external disturbances including climatic changes (Typical Meteorological data for Sydney is used). The analysis limitations and capabilities are highlighted. The model performance for month December is assessed showing its full capability to track the changes from power plant duty requirement and meteorological data within the time lapse of 0.01 s.",

                                "abstract": "Solar repowering of high pressure side feed water preheaters of post combustion carbon capture (PCC) retrofitted power plants offers a promising capability to offset the power plant output penalty due to capture plant reboiler duty. In this work, a model based approach is used to investigate the technical, operational and control aspects of the solar thermal installation of the super structure (power plant + PCC + solar thermal plant). The base case is a 660 MWe PCC-retrofitted power plant operating at 100% capacity and 90% capture rate in Australia. This is repowered by a solar thermal plant consisting of (a) a parabolic trough solar collector field with 806,520 m2 aperture area, (b) a thermal storage system with 8 full load hours of thermal storage and (c) an auxiliary gas heating unit, ensuring the solar thermal plant provides the high pressure side feed water preheating duty at all times without requirement to withdraw any steam from the power plant turbine circuit. A total of 230 MWth is provided from the solar thermal plant installation, being 100% supply for high pressure and intermediate feed water preheaters duty plus a surplus of 30% for maintaining the deaerator operation. A key feature here is trying to eliminate the frequent changes to the steam flow rate in the turbine circuit for solar feed water preheating and thus promoting ease of retrofit of repowering technology to PCC-retrofitted power plants. Details of the component sizing and modelling of solar thermal installation are provided and control and operating schemes are identified and analysed. A comprehensive dynamic model in TRNSYS dynamic modelling software is developed and used to analyse the solar thermal plant dynamic responses to external disturbances including climatic changes (Typical Meteorological data for Sydney is used). The analysis limitations and capabilities are highlighted. The model performance for month December is assessed showing its full capability to track the changes from power plant duty requirement and meteorological data within the time lapse of 0.01 s.",

One possible way to take advantage of OSDA-free beta is to apply the material in energy-efficient capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from a variety of large emission sources. For this reason, we have investigated the CO2 adsorption\u2013desorption properties of OSDA-free beta for the first time. The results of elemental analysis, N2 and CO2 adsorption\u2013desorption, evaluation of the isosteric heat of adsorption and solid-state NMR measurements have shown that OSDA-free beta exhibited higher crystallinity, larger pore volume and higher aluminum (Al) as well as sodium (Na) cation content with enhanced homogeneity in Al distribution within the *BEA framework as compared to the conventional TEA-directed beta synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH). These unique properties of OSDA-free beta resulted in significant improvements of CO2 adsorption\u2013desorption capability over a wide pressure region under moderate temperature in comparison with conventional zeolite beta.",

The recovery boiler is also part of the facility that regenerates the chemicals at the pulp mill. The purpose of this work is to investigate the technical performance and cost when capturing CO2 from the flue gases from the recovery boiler. In order to broaden the analysis different supplementary fuels have been used to satisfy the increased energy demand due to the CO2 capture. The aim with the project is to evaluate whether or not capturing the CO2 from the exhaust gases in the recover boiler is a cost effective way of reducing the CO2 emissions.",

Reserves of fossil fuels are in fact sufficient for several generations and their use can be continued if their greenhouse gas emissions can be captured and sequestered or otherwise offset. Forecasts for future energy technologies foresee considerable reductions in the role for combustion technologies. It is important that combustion researchers become involved in such forecasting so that viable combustion technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration do not become sidelined by over-optimistic projections for photo-voltaics and the hydrogen economy. It is evident that many energy technologies will undergo at least two stages in transition to achieving the goals that are needed by 2050. Furthermore, there will be many factors such as geography and economic and policy changes that will have drastic effects on the marketability of energy systems. Combustion systems will need to be able to respond quickly to these rapidly changing markets. There is a vitally important role for advanced computer modelling in meeting this challenge. Current combustor modelling capability is of only peripheral use in the development of new combustion systems. The main problem is in the modelling of turbulence chemistry interactions. Considerable investment is needed in the development of advanced modelling approaches and in high quality measurements of an hierarchy of experimental data bases that will provide physical insights and become a basis for model validation.",

The development of membranes and their advantages and limitations are clearly presented. Recently developed polymeric membranes are reviewed from critical point of view, and some results under real conditions are also reported.

The influences of operating pressure and oxygen/recycled flue gas (RFG) blend ratio on the combustion characteristics of oxy-coal firing were examined, especially on the exhausted CO2 concentration. High purity CO2 (94.1%) at the exit of the system was achieved for oxy-coal combustion at the optimized operation conditions (i.e., an RFG flow rate of 227 Nm3/h, feeding rates of oxygen and coal of 42.5 Nm3/h and 21 kg/h, respectively, and a slightly positive pressure of +100 Pa). The achievement of 94.1% CO2 emission has great potential for reducing CO2 emissions by carbon capture and storage and thus mitigating global climate change. Moreover, compared with air-firing operation, an NO emission reduction of around 66% was obtained in the oxy-firing operation.",

Nevertheless, the development of efficient gas storage/separation technologies requires fundamental knowledge of fluid transport in narrow pore spaces, since the behavior of fluids under tight confinement differs markedly from that in the bulk. Along with the rapid development of a broad range of new microporous materials such as carbide derived carbons (CDCs), carbon nanotubes and metalnorganic frameworks, there has been wide growth in their potential applications, especially in emerging nanotechnologies, thus the development of this understanding has become even more crucial. This study contributes to such understanding by investigating adsorption and transport of industrially important gases in the microporous structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon (SiC-DC). Initially, a realistic model of silicon carbide-derived carbon is developed using the hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) method, which reliably represents the atomistic structure of the actual carbon sample and successfully predicts its gas adsorption and fluid transport properties. Following this part, structural characteristics of the constructed model are investigated using different computational methods to reveal the underlying correlations between such characteristics and the behavior of fluid transport in the highly disordered structure of SiC-DC. This study also explores adsorption and self-diffusion of fluid molecules in the amorphous SiC-CD model, providing more insight into the internal resistances and energy barriers to gas diffusion. The strong influence of structural heterogeneity arising from the disordered nature of the microporous carbon on molecular diffusion is also examined here using a range of computational techniques. The computational methods employed include molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, nudged elastic band (NEB) method and analysis of the free energy map of the system. It is shown that disordered structure of SiC-DC has larger energy barriers to diffusion of carbon dioxide, rather than methane despite smaller molecular size of CO2. It is also demonstrated that activation energy barriers for methane obtained from MD simulation are in remarkable agreement with that of macroscopic kinetic uptake at low loading, which is an indication of accuracy of the HRMC constructed model in capturing internal resistances and constrictions of the actual sample. However, quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements suggests a smaller activation energy barrier for methane compared to the results obtained from MD simulations and macroscopic kinetic uptake experiments, which is due to the much smaller length scale in QENS compared to the macroscopic length scale. Due to the significance of water adsorption in industrial applications, one chapter of this study is exclusively dedicated to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor in the hydrophobic microporous structure of SiC-DC. It is shown that the cooperative effect of pore confinement and electrostatically mediated hydrogen bonding has a critical influence, by facilitating the formation of water clusters. These clusters are shown to ultimately lead to pore blockage and disrupting fluid transport within pore network. Further, this research focuses on the development of a fluorine-doped water-rejective structure, constructed based on the HRMC model of SiC-DC. In a unique study, the fluorine-doped structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon is modelled to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor and carbon dioxide in an apparently hydrophobic microporous carbon structure. A new first-principles force field is developed to serve this purpose. It is demonstrated that while fluorination generates more hydrophilic carbon surfaces, they actually act as super-hydrophobic structures due to enhanced energy barriers in the disordered network of microporous carbon. This novel finding, in addition to the investigations of this study on internal energy barriers for non-polar gases, provides better understanding of the energy barriers to molecular transport in SiC-DC and the apparently dual effect of fluorination. It is demonstrated that such activation energy barriers stem from binding of fluid molecules inside the pore network, rather than repulsion or steric hindrance to the diffusion of molecules through narrow pore entries. It is shown that fluorination not only decreases adsorption of carbon dioxide in contrast to water, but also lowers the activation energy barrier for CO2 diffusion in the microporous structure, thus it appears that fluorination can improve selectivity of CO2 over water vapor in CO2/H2O gas mixtures. The results obtained from this study not only help to provide better understanding of gas adsorption and fluid transport mechanisms in the pristine and fluorine-doped structure of disordered microporous carbon, but also to realise limitations of the current computational and experimental techniques for characterization of the structure, and investigations of the transport. This in turn will assist in providing directions for development of new modelling and characterization techniques. Finally, it is noted that current thesis is organised based on publications, so that each chapter is self-subsistent, with its own independent nomenclature. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to organise the publications into chapters in logical and consistent sequence.",

High purity CO2 (94.1%) at the exit of the system was achieved for oxy-coal combustion at the optimized operation conditions (i.e., an RFG flow rate of 227 Nm3/h, feeding rates of oxygen and coal of 42.5 Nm3/h and 21 kg/h, respectively, and a slightly positive pressure of +100 Pa). The achievement of 94.1% CO2 emission has great potential for reducing CO2 emissions by carbon capture and storage and thus mitigating global climate change.

To make this option economically competitive compared to other CO 2 capture techniques, a better understanding of its dynamic behavior is required. In this study, data generated using a central composite experimental design (CCD) with varying light intensity, CO 2 and phosphate concentration was used to develop a mathematical model that describes the kinetics of algal growth and CO 2 , phosphate, nitrate and ammonium uptake rate of Chlorella kessleri cultivated in oil sands process water (OSPW). The model considers the uncoupling between nutrients uptake and growth and the possibility of luxurious uptake of nutrients. This nonlinear dynamic model was used to determine the optimal CO 2 concentration, phosphate concentration and light intensity for CO 2 uptake and algal growth over a period of time in a batch culture using a multi-objective optimization technique to maximize CO 2 fixation and algal growth simultaneously.",

To make this option economically competitive compared to other CO 2 capture techniques, a better understanding of its dynamic behavior is required. In this study, data generated using a central composite experimental design (CCD) with varying light intensity, CO 2 and phosphate concentration was used to develop a mathematical model that describes the kinetics of algal growth and CO 2 , phosphate, nitrate and ammonium uptake rate of Chlorella kessleri cultivated in oil sands process water (OSPW). The model considers the uncoupling between nutrients uptake and growth and the possibility of luxurious uptake of nutrients. This nonlinear dynamic model was used to determine the optimal CO 2 concentration, phosphate concentration and light intensity for CO 2 uptake and algal growth over a period of time in a batch culture using a multi-objective optimization technique to maximize CO 2 fixation and algal growth simultaneously.",

                                        "abstract": "Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a relatively new method to produce hydrogen (H2) and is also used as an energy conversion method for solid, liquid or gaseous fuels. There are various advantages of this method such as inherent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, minimal NOx emissions and the H2 production. In this process, there is no direct contact between the fuel and oxidizer. This method utilizes oxygen from an oxygen carrier which may be a transition metal. The idea is to split the combustion process into three separate sub-processes by employing three separate reactors: air reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized by air, fuel reactor where natural gas is oxidized to produce a stream of CO2 and H2O and steam reactor where the steam is reduced to produce H2. In this study, a thermodynamic model with iron oxides as oxygen carrier has been developed using Aspen Plus by employing conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLR system. The developed model was employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters such as mass flow rates of air, fuel, steam and oxygen carrier and fraction of inert material on H2 and CO2 production and key reactor temperatures. The results show that the H2 production increases with the increase in air, fuel and steam flow rates up to a certain limit and stays constant for higher flow rates. The CO2 production follows a similar trend. Similarly, the H2 production also increases with the increase in oxide flow rate and fraction of inert material up to a particular value, but then decrease for higher oxide flow rates and inert fractions. Reactor temperatures were also observed in this study. The temperatures increase with the increase of steam and air flow rates till the stoichiometric values and decrease thereafter. Increase in the fuel flow rate shows a decreasing trend in all the reactor temperatures. The reactor temperatures increase with the increase in oxide flow rates and the decrease of the inert mass fraction. The data obtained from the simulations is also used for exergetic analysis of the system. The overall exergetic efficiency was found to decrease with steam, air and oxide flow rates and increase with the increase in the fuel flow rate and the fraction of inert material.",

                                        "abstract": "Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a relatively new method to produce hydrogen (H2) and is also used as an energy conversion method for solid, liquid or gaseous fuels. There are various advantages of this method such as inherent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, minimal NOx emissions and the H2 production. In this process, there is no direct contact between the fuel and oxidizer. This method utilizes oxygen from an oxygen carrier which may be a transition metal. The idea is to split the combustion process into three separate sub-processes by employing three separate reactors: air reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized by air, fuel reactor where natural gas is oxidized to produce a stream of CO2 and H2O and steam reactor where the steam is reduced to produce H2. In this study, a thermodynamic model with iron oxides as oxygen carrier has been developed using Aspen Plus by employing conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLR system. The developed model was employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters such as mass flow rates of air, fuel, steam and oxygen carrier and fraction of inert material on H2 and CO2 production and key reactor temperatures. The results show that the H2 production increases with the increase in air, fuel and steam flow rates up to a certain limit and stays constant for higher flow rates. The CO2 production follows a similar trend. Similarly, the H2 production also increases with the increase in oxide flow rate and fraction of inert material up to a particular value, but then decrease for higher oxide flow rates and inert fractions. Reactor temperatures were also observed in this study. The temperatures increase with the increase of steam and air flow rates till the stoichiometric values and decrease thereafter. Increase in the fuel flow rate shows a decreasing trend in all the reactor temperatures. The reactor temperatures increase with the increase in oxide flow rates and the decrease of the inert mass fraction. The data obtained from the simulations is also used for exergetic analysis of the system. The overall exergetic efficiency was found to decrease with steam, air and oxide flow rates and increase with the increase in the fuel flow rate and the fraction of inert material.",

This work, for the first time, has investigated the adsorption of CO2 on newly experimentally realized cage-like B40 fullerene (Zhai et al., 2014) based on density functional theory calculations. We find that the adsorption of CO2 on B40 fullerene involves a relatively large energy barrier (1.21 eV), however this can be greatly decreased to 0.35 eV by introducing an extra electron. A practical way to realize negatively charged B40 fullerene is then proposed by encapsulating a Li atom into the B40 fullerene (Li@B40). Li@B40 is found to be highly stable and can significantly enhance both the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 adsorption, while the adsorptions of N2, CH4 and H2 on the Li@B40 fullerene remain weak in comparison. Since B40 fullerene has been successfully synthesized in a most recent experiment, our results highlight a new promising material for CO2 capture and separation for future experimental validation.",

                                        "abstract": "A family of nitrogen-enriched ultramicroporous carbon materials was prepared by direct carbonization of task-specifically designed molecular carbon precursors of cyanopyridinium-based crystalline dicationic salts (CISs). Varying the molecular structure of CISs, large surface area (918 m(2) g(-1)), high N content (20.10 wt %), and narrow distributed ultramicropores (0.59 nm) can be simultaneously achieved on the sample PCN-14 derived from methyl-linked 4-cyanopyridinium D[4-CNPyMe]Tf2N. It therefore exhibited exceptional performance in greenhouse gas CO2 capture, i.e., simultaneously possessing (1) high CO2 adsorption uptakes: 5.33 mmol g(-1) at 273 K, and 3.68 mmol g(-1) at 298 K (both at 1.0 bar); (2) unprecedented selectivity of CO2 versus N2: 156; and (3) a high adsorption ratio of CO2 to N2: 148 (at 1.0 bar). This is the first time such a high selectivity and adsorption ratio over carbon materials has been achieved, which is among the highest values over solid adsorbents.",

                                "abstract": "Microporous carbons were developed for CO2 capture from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) via a simple carbonization method. The carbonization was carried out in the temperature range of 400\u2013800 \u00b0C, and the effects of the carbonization temperature on the characteristics and CO2 adsorption behavior of the prepared carbon materials were investigated by both experiments and density functional theory studies. The textural characteristics of the carbon materials were highly dependent on the carbonization temperature, and narrow micropores (<0.7 nm) were predominantly generated from the decomposition of PVDF giving off fluorine during carbonization. The specific surface area and pore volume increased up to 1011 m2 g\u22121 and 0.416 cm3 g\u22121, respectively, and the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.59 mol kg\u22121 was obtained at 25 \u00b0C and \u223c1 bar in PVDF carbonized at 800 \u00b0C. The carbonized PVDFs also exhibited highly stable CO2 adsorption uptake and rapid kinetics through repeated adsorption\u2013desorption cycles, showing that carbonized PVDFs are promising adsorbents for CO2 capture. The density functional theory calculation suggested that stable configuration with favorable adsorption energy can be introduced by the removal of fluorine from PVDF, which results in the reduction of repulsive interactions between electronegative fluorine in PVDF and oxygen in CO2 molecule.",

                                "abstract": "Microporous carbons were developed for CO2 capture from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) via a simple carbonization method. The carbonization was carried out in the temperature range of 400\u2013800 \u00b0C, and the effects of the carbonization temperature on the characteristics and CO2 adsorption behavior of the prepared carbon materials were investigated by both experiments and density functional theory studies. The textural characteristics of the carbon materials were highly dependent on the carbonization temperature, and narrow micropores (<0.7 nm) were predominantly generated from the decomposition of PVDF giving off fluorine during carbonization. The specific surface area and pore volume increased up to 1011 m2 g\u22121 and 0.416 cm3 g\u22121, respectively, and the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.59 mol kg\u22121 was obtained at 25 \u00b0C and \u223c1 bar in PVDF carbonized at 800 \u00b0C. The carbonized PVDFs also exhibited highly stable CO2 adsorption uptake and rapid kinetics through repeated adsorption\u2013desorption cycles, showing that carbonized PVDFs are promising adsorbents for CO2 capture. The density functional theory calculation suggested that stable configuration with favorable adsorption energy can be introduced by the removal of fluorine from PVDF, which results in the reduction of repulsive interactions between electronegative fluorine in PVDF and oxygen in CO2 molecule.",

The results of elemental analysis, N2 and CO2 adsorption\u2013desorption, evaluation of the isosteric heat of adsorption and solid-state NMR measurements have shown that OSDA-free beta exhibited higher crystallinity, larger pore volume and higher aluminum (Al) as well as sodium (Na) cation content with enhanced homogeneity in Al distribution within the *BEA framework as compared to the conventional TEA-directed beta synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH).

                                "abstract": "Abstract Herein, a signal-amplified photoelectrochemical sensing platform based on interwoven titanate nanotubes and carbon nanohorns conjugates was constructed for folic acid determination. Specifically, titanate nanotubes with reticulation structure were employed as optoelectronic element, which possessed fine photocatalytic activity and enhancement in facilitating fast and long-distance electron transport. Hierarchical-structured carbon nanohorns were introduced as the mainstay to provide as the electron-transport medium to capture and transmit electrons from excited titanate nanotubes to the sensing matrix owing to the prominent conductivity and large surface. Furthermore, the holes from valence band of stimulated titanate nanotubes could transfer to their surface and be consumed by folic acid, thus enhancing the photocurrent response. Hence, under the optimal conditions, a linear relationship between photocurrent increase and logarithm concentration of folic acid was obtained in the wide range from 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 to 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 M with a detection limit of (2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211 M. The well-designed transducer showed practical advantages, such as universality, simplicity and convenience, opening up a valuable application for other important molecules assessment.",

Polystyrene divinylbenzene resins are known for their high surface area and porosity to effectively capture metal ions after suitable modification. In this work, we report the anchoring of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole onto the amine functionalized Amberlite XAD-1180 resin for the effective adsorption of palladium. The macroreticular resin serves as a good host to welcome palladium (guest) and the proof of concept was established comprehensively using FT-IR, SEM, EDX and optical imaging analysis. The Langmuir adsorption capacity of the functionalized resin for Pd 2+ acquired through the linear isotherm model was found to be 50.00\u00a0mg\u00a0g \u22121 . Kinetics of the adsorption process synchronized well with the pseudo-second order model and furthermore the exergonic and endothermic nature of the adsorption process was quantified through the negative free energy and positive enthalpy values. Regeneration of the resin surface was done using thiourea and the method was tested in recovering palladium from a spent catalyst containing 5% Pd on activated carbon.",

This work, for the first time, has investigated the adsorption of CO2 on newly experimentally realized cage-like B40 fullerene (Zhai et al., 2014) based on density functional theory calculations. We find that the adsorption of CO2 on B40 fullerene involves a relatively large energy barrier (1.21 eV), however this can be greatly decreased to 0.35 eV by introducing an extra electron. A practical way to realize negatively charged B40 fullerene is then proposed by encapsulating a Li atom into the B40 fullerene (Li@B40). Li@B40 is found to be highly stable and can significantly enhance both the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 adsorption, while the adsorptions of N2, CH4 and H2 on the Li@B40 fullerene remain weak in comparison. Since B40 fullerene has been successfully synthesized in a most recent experiment, our results highlight a new promising material for CO2 capture and separation for future experimental validation.",

Considerable variation in sorption capacity was found with a ratio of 20:1 between the best-performing (bone char) and the poorest-performing (peat char) samples.

However, further surface functionalization of MCN for advanced nanomaterials and catalysis still remains very challenging. Here we show that acidic carboxyl groups can be smoothly introduced onto the surface of well-ordered MCN without annihilation between the introduced acid groups and MCN's inherent basic groups through a facile UV light oxidation method. The functionalization generates a novel bifunctional nanocatalyst which offers an enzyme-like catalytic performance in the one-pot deacetalization-Knoevenagel reaction of benzaldehyde dimethylacetal and malononitrile with 100% conversion and more than 99% selectivity due to the cooperative catalysis between the acid and base groups separated on the surface of the catalyst. The results provide a general method to create multifunctional nanomaterials and open new opportunities for the development of high efficient catalyst for green organic synthesis.",

GelMA hydrogels closely resemble some essential properties of native extracellular matrix (ECM) due to the presence of cell-attaching and matrix metalloproteinase responsive peptide motifs, which allow cells to proliferate and spread in GelMA-based scaffolds. GelMA is also versatile from a processing perspective. It crosslinks when exposed to light irradiation to form hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties. It can also be microfabricated using different methodologies including micromolding, photomasking, bioprinting, self-assembly, and microfluidic techniques to generate constructs with controlled architectures. Hybrid hydrogel systems can also be formed by mixing GelMA with nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide, and other polymers to form networks with desired combined properties and characteristics for specific biological applications. Recent research has demonstrated the proficiency of GelMA-based hydrogels in a wide range of tissue engineering applications including engineering of bone, cartilage, cardiac, and vascular tissues, among others. Other applications of GelMA hydrogels, besides tissue engineering, include fundamental cell research, cell signaling, drug and gene delivery, and bio-sensing.",

The development of membranes and their advantages and limitations are clearly presented. Recently developed polymeric membranes are reviewed from critical point of view, and some results under real conditions are also reported. A new approach for obtaining tailor-made polymeric membranes with a CO2-phillic surface, manufactured as thin films is described. The membranes developed by this approach exhibit outstanding separation performance with promising results for flue gas treatment.",

However, further surface functionalization of MCN for advanced nanomaterials and catalysis still remains very challenging. Here we show that acidic carboxyl groups can be smoothly introduced onto the surface of well-ordered MCN without annihilation between the introduced acid groups and MCN's inherent basic groups through a facile UV light oxidation method. The functionalization generates a novel bifunctional nanocatalyst which offers an enzyme-like catalytic performance in the one-pot deacetalization-Knoevenagel reaction of benzaldehyde dimethylacetal and malononitrile with 100% conversion and more than 99% selectivity due to the cooperative catalysis between the acid and base groups separated on the surface of the catalyst. The results provide a general method to create multifunctional nanomaterials and open new opportunities for the development of high efficient catalyst for green organic synthesis.",

Varying the molecular structure of CISs, large surface area (918 m(2) g(-1)), high N content (20.10 wt %), and narrow distributed ultramicropores (0.59 nm) can be simultaneously achieved on the sample PCN-14 derived from methyl-linked 4-cyanopyridinium D[4-CNPyMe]Tf2N. It therefore exhibited exceptional performance in greenhouse gas CO2 capture, i.e., simultaneously possessing (1) high CO2 adsorption uptakes: 5.33 mmol g(-1) at 273 K, and 3.68 mmol g(-1) at 298 K (both at 1.0 bar); (2) unprecedented selectivity of CO2 versus N2: 156; and (3) a high adsorption ratio of CO2 to N2: 148 (at 1.0 bar). This is the first time such a high selectivity and adsorption ratio over carbon materials has been achieved, which is among the highest values over solid adsorbents.",

Herein, carbon nanofiber (CNF)/polyurethane (PU) nanocomposites are studied for tactile imaging and distributed strain sensing via electrical impedance tomography (EIT) by investigating the influence of filler volume fraction on microscale morphology, piezoresistive response while bonded to mechanically loaded substrates, and sensitivity to distributed strain. Load testing of the bonded sensor reveals that viscoelasticity and filler volume fraction profoundly affect the piezoresistive response. EIT is able to accurately capture and discern between multiple points of contact in each volume fraction with lower volume fractions being more sensitive thereby demonstrating the potential of utilizing tomographic methods for tactile imaging and distributed strain sensing in PU-based nanocomposites.",

                                        "abstract": "The adsorption of volatile gases in microporous materials has wide applications in gas separation, including CO2 capture and natural gas dehydration. It has also attracted a large amount of attention for energy storage applications such as electrochemical energy storage in supercapacitors and adsorptive methane/hydrogen storage. Nevertheless, the development of efficient gas storage/separation technologies requires fundamental knowledge of fluid transport in narrow pore spaces, since the behavior of fluids under tight confinement differs markedly from that in the bulk. Along with the rapid development of a broad range of new microporous materials such as carbide derived carbons (CDCs), carbon nanotubes and metalnorganic frameworks, there has been wide growth in their potential applications, especially in emerging nanotechnologies, thus the development of this understanding has become even more crucial. This study contributes to such understanding by investigating adsorption and transport of industrially important gases in the microporous structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon (SiC-DC). Initially, a realistic model of silicon carbide-derived carbon is developed using the hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) method, which reliably represents the atomistic structure of the actual carbon sample and successfully predicts its gas adsorption and fluid transport properties. Following this part, structural characteristics of the constructed model are investigated using different computational methods to reveal the underlying correlations between such characteristics and the behavior of fluid transport in the highly disordered structure of SiC-DC. This study also explores adsorption and self-diffusion of fluid molecules in the amorphous SiC-CD model, providing more insight into the internal resistances and energy barriers to gas diffusion. The strong influence of structural heterogeneity arising from the disordered nature of the microporous carbon on molecular diffusion is also examined here using a range of computational techniques. The computational methods employed include molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, nudged elastic band (NEB) method and analysis of the free energy map of the system. It is shown that disordered structure of SiC-DC has larger energy barriers to diffusion of carbon dioxide, rather than methane despite smaller molecular size of CO2. It is also demonstrated that activation energy barriers for methane obtained from MD simulation are in remarkable agreement with that of macroscopic kinetic uptake at low loading, which is an indication of accuracy of the HRMC constructed model in capturing internal resistances and constrictions of the actual sample. However, quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements suggests a smaller activation energy barrier for methane compared to the results obtained from MD simulations and macroscopic kinetic uptake experiments, which is due to the much smaller length scale in QENS compared to the macroscopic length scale. Due to the significance of water adsorption in industrial applications, one chapter of this study is exclusively dedicated to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor in the hydrophobic microporous structure of SiC-DC. It is shown that the cooperative effect of pore confinement and electrostatically mediated hydrogen bonding has a critical influence, by facilitating the formation of water clusters. These clusters are shown to ultimately lead to pore blockage and disrupting fluid transport within pore network. Further, this research focuses on the development of a fluorine-doped water-rejective structure, constructed based on the HRMC model of SiC-DC. In a unique study, the fluorine-doped structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon is modelled to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor and carbon dioxide in an apparently hydrophobic microporous carbon structure. A new first-principles force field is developed to serve this purpose. It is demonstrated that while fluorination generates more hydrophilic carbon surfaces, they actually act as super-hydrophobic structures due to enhanced energy barriers in the disordered network of microporous carbon. This novel finding, in addition to the investigations of this study on internal energy barriers for non-polar gases, provides better understanding of the energy barriers to molecular transport in SiC-DC and the apparently dual effect of fluorination. It is demonstrated that such activation energy barriers stem from binding of fluid molecules inside the pore network, rather than repulsion or steric hindrance to the diffusion of molecules through narrow pore entries. It is shown that fluorination not only decreases adsorption of carbon dioxide in contrast to water, but also lowers the activation energy barrier for CO2 diffusion in the microporous structure, thus it appears that fluorination can improve selectivity of CO2 over water vapor in CO2/H2O gas mixtures. The results obtained from this study not only help to provide better understanding of gas adsorption and fluid transport mechanisms in the pristine and fluorine-doped structure of disordered microporous carbon, but also to realise limitations of the current computational and experimental techniques for characterization of the structure, and investigations of the transport. This in turn will assist in providing directions for development of new modelling and characterization techniques. Finally, it is noted that current thesis is organised based on publications, so that each chapter is self-subsistent, with its own independent nomenclature. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to organise the publications into chapters in logical and consistent sequence.",

                                        "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the properties of surface oxygen-containing functional groups (SOFG) on activated carbons, and their effects on removal of gaseous mercury chloride (HgCl 2 ). For this purpose, the surface of a coal-based commercial activated carbon BPL was modified by heating in an inert atmosphere and then impregnated with benzoic acid solution. Afterwards, all carbonaceous samples were tested for their HgCl 2 adsorption capacities. Nitrogen (N 2 ) adsorption, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Boehm titration were applied to study the surface characteristics of carbon samples. It was found that after benzoic acid impregnation, the amounts of SOFG improved with the increasing of benzoic acid concentration, especially carboxylic and carbonyl groups. Adsorption experiments showed that higher HgCl 2 adsorption capacities were obtained with more carboxyl and carbonyl groups. And the largest capacity obtained in this study was 484.7\u00a0\u03bcg/g of carbon with carboxyl and carbonyl concentrations of 0.570\u00a0mmol/g and 0.706\u00a0mmol/g, respectively. This suggests that carboxylic and carbonyl groups play predominant roles in HgCl 2 removal. And carboxylic groups are believed to contribute more than that of carbonyl groups in HgCl 2 capture process.",

                                        "abstract": "Abstract Carbon Capture and Storage is developed as state-of-the-art method to bring CO 2 emissions under control. Among different options, saline aquifers are viable choices to sequestrate CO 2 in which this gas can be dissolved in the pertinent brine through a gradual progressive diffusive layer and subsequent possible density-induced convection. Quantification of CO 2 dissolution rate in saline aquifers is dependent on the true estimation of CO 2 diffusivity in brine. In this work, equilibrium dissolution and diffusion coefficient of CO 2 in water-saturated porous medium is modeled. The simple and well-known pressure-decay method is applied numerically in different porous systems. Also, interference of density-driven convection using different permeability values is addressed and the idea of using a porous medium such as glass bead model is proposed to block convective swirls or postpone onset of convection. Convective currents are suppressed at Rayleigh numbers (Ra) fewer than 40. For controlled convective dissolution, the onset of convection should be late enough for that early diffusive dissolution to dominate. Also, convective dissolution should deviate from diffusive dissolution to find the onset of convection and time at the end of early convection. The former and latter require Ra\u00a0 \u00a0150, respectively. Under these circumstances, pressure decay results can be analyzed to estimate the gas\u2013liquid diffusion coefficient using early pressure\u2013time data, onset of convection, the maximum Sherwood and time at the end of early convection.",

                                        "abstract": "Abstract Carbon Capture and Storage is developed as state-of-the-art method to bring CO 2 emissions under control. Among different options, saline aquifers are viable choices to sequestrate CO 2 in which this gas can be dissolved in the pertinent brine through a gradual progressive diffusive layer and subsequent possible density-induced convection. Quantification of CO 2 dissolution rate in saline aquifers is dependent on the true estimation of CO 2 diffusivity in brine. In this work, equilibrium dissolution and diffusion coefficient of CO 2 in water-saturated porous medium is modeled. The simple and well-known pressure-decay method is applied numerically in different porous systems. Also, interference of density-driven convection using different permeability values is addressed and the idea of using a porous medium such as glass bead model is proposed to block convective swirls or postpone onset of convection. Convective currents are suppressed at Rayleigh numbers (Ra) fewer than 40. For controlled convective dissolution, the onset of convection should be late enough for that early diffusive dissolution to dominate. Also, convective dissolution should deviate from diffusive dissolution to find the onset of convection and time at the end of early convection. The former and latter require Ra\u00a0 \u00a0150, respectively. Under these circumstances, pressure decay results can be analyzed to estimate the gas\u2013liquid diffusion coefficient using early pressure\u2013time data, onset of convection, the maximum Sherwood and time at the end of early convection.",

The influences of operating pressure and oxygen/recycled flue gas (RFG) blend ratio on the combustion characteristics of oxy-coal firing were examined, especially on the exhausted CO2 concentration. High purity CO2 (94.1%) at the exit of the system was achieved for oxy-coal combustion at the optimized operation conditions (i.e., an RFG flow rate of 227 Nm3/h, feeding rates of oxygen and coal of 42.5 Nm3/h and 21 kg/h, respectively, and a slightly positive pressure of +100 Pa). The achievement of 94.1% CO2 emission has great potential for reducing CO2 emissions by carbon capture and storage and thus mitigating global climate change. Moreover, compared with air-firing operation, an NO emission reduction of around 66% was obtained in the oxy-firing operation.",

This chapter refers to the use of monosaccharides as energy reserves in plants. Although a large plethora of substrates such as proteins and lipids can be oxidized in plants, respiration tends to be dominated by carbohydrate oxidation through the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The chapter explains the process of glycolysis. Glycolysis or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway is one of the best established pathways of carbohydrate metabolism in plants. It is one of the two major pathways by which carbohydrate is degraded ultimately to carbon dioxide, the other being the pentose phosphate pathway. These pathways are catabolic and are concerned with converting the carbon in reduced form, which has been captured from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, into an oxidized form with the release of energy. Glycolysis is a key metabolic feature of the respiratory process of the plant cell and is particularly important in the cells of germinating seedlings and in nonphotosynthetic cells of the mature plant. The chapter also explains pentose phosphate pathway in detail. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the citric acid cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phophorylation.",

This chapter refers to the use of monosaccharides as energy reserves in plants. Although a large plethora of substrates such as proteins and lipids can be oxidized in plants, respiration tends to be dominated by carbohydrate oxidation through the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The chapter explains the process of glycolysis. Glycolysis or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway is one of the best established pathways of carbohydrate metabolism in plants. It is one of the two major pathways by which carbohydrate is degraded ultimately to carbon dioxide, the other being the pentose phosphate pathway. These pathways are catabolic and are concerned with converting the carbon in reduced form, which has been captured from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, into an oxidized form with the release of energy. Glycolysis is a key metabolic feature of the respiratory process of the plant cell and is particularly important in the cells of germinating seedlings and in nonphotosynthetic cells of the mature plant. The chapter also explains pentose phosphate pathway in detail. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the citric acid cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phophorylation.",

This work, for the first time, has investigated the adsorption of CO2 on newly experimentally realized cage-like B40 fullerene (Zhai et al., 2014) based on density functional theory calculations. We find that the adsorption of CO2 on B40 fullerene involves a relatively large energy barrier (1.21 eV), however this can be greatly decreased to 0.35 eV by introducing an extra electron. A practical way to realize negatively charged B40 fullerene is then proposed by encapsulating a Li atom into the B40 fullerene (Li@B40). Li@B40 is found to be highly stable and can significantly enhance both the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 adsorption, while the adsorptions of N2, CH4 and H2 on the Li@B40 fullerene remain weak in comparison. Since B40 fullerene has been successfully synthesized in a most recent experiment, our results highlight a new promising material for CO2 capture and separation for future experimental validation.",

                                        "abstract": "The adsorption of volatile gases in microporous materials has wide applications in gas separation, including CO2 capture and natural gas dehydration. It has also attracted a large amount of attention for energy storage applications such as electrochemical energy storage in supercapacitors and adsorptive methane/hydrogen storage. Nevertheless, the development of efficient gas storage/separation technologies requires fundamental knowledge of fluid transport in narrow pore spaces, since the behavior of fluids under tight confinement differs markedly from that in the bulk. Along with the rapid development of a broad range of new microporous materials such as carbide derived carbons (CDCs), carbon nanotubes and metalnorganic frameworks, there has been wide growth in their potential applications, especially in emerging nanotechnologies, thus the development of this understanding has become even more crucial. This study contributes to such understanding by investigating adsorption and transport of industrially important gases in the microporous structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon (SiC-DC). Initially, a realistic model of silicon carbide-derived carbon is developed using the hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) method, which reliably represents the atomistic structure of the actual carbon sample and successfully predicts its gas adsorption and fluid transport properties. Following this part, structural characteristics of the constructed model are investigated using different computational methods to reveal the underlying correlations between such characteristics and the behavior of fluid transport in the highly disordered structure of SiC-DC. This study also explores adsorption and self-diffusion of fluid molecules in the amorphous SiC-CD model, providing more insight into the internal resistances and energy barriers to gas diffusion. The strong influence of structural heterogeneity arising from the disordered nature of the microporous carbon on molecular diffusion is also examined here using a range of computational techniques. The computational methods employed include molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, nudged elastic band (NEB) method and analysis of the free energy map of the system. It is shown that disordered structure of SiC-DC has larger energy barriers to diffusion of carbon dioxide, rather than methane despite smaller molecular size of CO2. It is also demonstrated that activation energy barriers for methane obtained from MD simulation are in remarkable agreement with that of macroscopic kinetic uptake at low loading, which is an indication of accuracy of the HRMC constructed model in capturing internal resistances and constrictions of the actual sample. However, quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements suggests a smaller activation energy barrier for methane compared to the results obtained from MD simulations and macroscopic kinetic uptake experiments, which is due to the much smaller length scale in QENS compared to the macroscopic length scale. Due to the significance of water adsorption in industrial applications, one chapter of this study is exclusively dedicated to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor in the hydrophobic microporous structure of SiC-DC. It is shown that the cooperative effect of pore confinement and electrostatically mediated hydrogen bonding has a critical influence, by facilitating the formation of water clusters. These clusters are shown to ultimately lead to pore blockage and disrupting fluid transport within pore network. Further, this research focuses on the development of a fluorine-doped water-rejective structure, constructed based on the HRMC model of SiC-DC. In a unique study, the fluorine-doped structure of silicon carbide-derived carbon is modelled to investigate adsorption and transport of water vapor and carbon dioxide in an apparently hydrophobic microporous carbon structure. A new first-principles force field is developed to serve this purpose. It is demonstrated that while fluorination generates more hydrophilic carbon surfaces, they actually act as super-hydrophobic structures due to enhanced energy barriers in the disordered network of microporous carbon. This novel finding, in addition to the investigations of this study on internal energy barriers for non-polar gases, provides better understanding of the energy barriers to molecular transport in SiC-DC and the apparently dual effect of fluorination. It is demonstrated that such activation energy barriers stem from binding of fluid molecules inside the pore network, rather than repulsion or steric hindrance to the diffusion of molecules through narrow pore entries. It is shown that fluorination not only decreases adsorption of carbon dioxide in contrast to water, but also lowers the activation energy barrier for CO2 diffusion in the microporous structure, thus it appears that fluorination can improve selectivity of CO2 over water vapor in CO2/H2O gas mixtures. The results obtained from this study not only help to provide better understanding of gas adsorption and fluid transport mechanisms in the pristine and fluorine-doped structure of disordered microporous carbon, but also to realise limitations of the current computational and experimental techniques for characterization of the structure, and investigations of the transport. This in turn will assist in providing directions for development of new modelling and characterization techniques. Finally, it is noted that current thesis is organised based on publications, so that each chapter is self-subsistent, with its own independent nomenclature. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to organise the publications into chapters in logical and consistent sequence.",

However, further surface functionalization of MCN for advanced nanomaterials and catalysis still remains very challenging. Here we show that acidic carboxyl groups can be smoothly introduced onto the surface of well-ordered MCN without annihilation between the introduced acid groups and MCN's inherent basic groups through a facile UV light oxidation method. The functionalization generates a novel bifunctional nanocatalyst which offers an enzyme-like catalytic performance in the one-pot deacetalization-Knoevenagel reaction of benzaldehyde dimethylacetal and malononitrile with 100% conversion and more than 99% selectivity due to the cooperative catalysis between the acid and base groups separated on the surface of the catalyst. The results provide a general method to create multifunctional nanomaterials and open new opportunities for the development of high efficient catalyst for green organic synthesis.",

Varying the molecular structure of CISs, large surface area (918 m(2) g(-1)), high N content (20.10 wt %), and narrow distributed ultramicropores (0.59 nm) can be simultaneously achieved on the sample PCN-14 derived from methyl-linked 4-cyanopyridinium D[4-CNPyMe]Tf2N. It therefore exhibited exceptional performance in greenhouse gas CO2 capture, i.e., simultaneously possessing (1) high CO2 adsorption uptakes: 5.33 mmol g(-1) at 273 K, and 3.68 mmol g(-1) at 298 K (both at 1.0 bar); (2) unprecedented selectivity of CO2 versus N2: 156; and (3) a high adsorption ratio of CO2 to N2: 148 (at 1.0 bar). This is the first time such a high selectivity and adsorption ratio over carbon materials has been achieved, which is among the highest values over solid adsorbents.",

Considering that the exposure may cause damage to public health, it seems inevitable that if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve for the management of the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment, and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries. While none are exact analogs, as a whole, the set offers variation in key variables critical for determining the success of carbon sequestration as a viable climate policy option.",

Considering that the exposure may cause damage to public health, it seems inevitable that if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve for the management of the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment, and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries. While none are exact analogs, as a whole, the set offers variation in key variables critical for determining the success of carbon sequestration as a viable climate policy option.",

                                "abstract": "Abstract A solution to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions is carbon capture and storage. At the Sleipner field, offshore Norway, carbon dioxide is separated from the produced gas and injected into the Utsira formation at approximately 1000\u00a0m depth. The Utsira formation is a high porosity saline aquifer that is 200\u2013300\u00a0m thick in the injection area. In 1994, two years before the injection started, a seismic survey was acquired. The survey has been followed up by several seismic surveys acquired to monitor the migration of the injected gas. The full waveform inversion (FWI) method is a non-linear inverse method for estimating subsurface elastic parameters. Time-lapse FWI has recently been suggested as a monitoring tool for resolving time-lapse changes directly in the elastic parameter models. This paper presents an application of a three dimensional implementation of isotropic elastic time-lapse FWI applied on time-lapse field data from the Sleipner area. The baseline dataset is the 1994 dataset, whereas the monitor dataset is the survey acquired in 2006 after ten years of injection. Time-lapse FWI is used to estimate separate elastic parameter models for both the baseline and the monitor datasets. The results show that FWI is able to estimate detailed elastic parameter models that produce synthetic data that match the field data. The inverted models are used in a pre-stack depth migration method to yield detailed seismic images of the Sleipner before and after the injection of the gas. The gas cloud after ten years of injection is clearly visible on the monitor seismic images. The baseline and monitor seismic images show events and discontinuities that can explain the migration pathways of the injected gas through the Utsira formation.",

                                        "abstract": "Existing monitoring protocols for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in geologic formations are provided by carbon dioxide capture and geological storage (CCS)-specific regulations and bodies including the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the European Union (EU) CCS and Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Directives, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Final Rules, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Modalities and Procedures (for developing countries). These protocols have varying levels of detail but similar principles and requirements for monitoring, and all include the need to quantify emissions and measure environmental impacts in the event of leakage to the surface. What they do not all include is the clarification that quantification monitoring should only be undertaken in cases where CO2 has been attributed to leakage and not when leakage is only suspected. Quantifying suspected emissions is a significant monitoring challenge and undertaking, and may rely on acquiring large data sets over long time periods. This level of effort in monitoring would be unnecessary if the source of CO2 detected at the surface is attributed to natural sources rather than from leakage, but a step to attribute CO2 source is either missing from these protocols or is outdated in technical scope. Regulatory bodies call for protocols to be updated based on technical advances, and ongoing technical advances into leakage monitoring have now benefited from a first-ever public claim of leakage over a geologic CO2 storage site in Saskatchewan, Canada, bringing more emphasis on the role of attribution monitoring. We present a brief update of some of the newest technical advances in attribution and suggest that CO2 \u2018attribution monitoring\u2019 could now be included in monitoring protocols to avoid unnecessary and costly quantification monitoring unless it is fully warranted. In this context, this paper describes an option to improve the existing protocols for monitoring CO2 at geological storage sites made possible because of recent developments in near-surface attribution monitoring techniques.",

It focuses on the cost of capturing CO2, with the implicit assumption that storage options would be relatively cheap, plentiful, and located in close proximity to future CO2 point sources. It provides an initial examination of the consequence of regionally disaggregated demand for, and supply of, CO2-storage reservoirs within the context of a globally disaggregated, long-term analysis of both the geology and economics of capture and storage (CCS). It is suggested that some regions see their ability to deploy CCS systems constrained by a lack of quality target reservoirs relative to major sources in that region. Other regions appear to have sufficient storage capacity to easily carry them through the 21st century. It also examines the degree to which the relative abundance of CCS opportunities in a region influences the adoption of other emissions-mitigation technologies. This chapter confirms that CCS is an important potential response to climate change throughout the 21st century and a technology that can help control the cost of addressing climate change.",

During sequestration, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas effluent is captured from coal-fired power plants or other concentrated emission sources and injected into saline aquifers or depleted oil reservoirs for long term storage. In an effort to fully understand and optimize CO2 trapping efficiency, the capillary mechanisms that immobilize subsurface CO2 were analyzed at the pore-scale. Pairs of proxy fluids representing the potential range of in-situ conditions of supercritical CO2 (nonwetting fluid) and brine (wetting fluid) were used during experimentation. The two fluids were imbibed and drained from a flow cell apparatus containing a sintered glass bead core. Fluid parameters (such as interfacial tension and fluid viscosities) and flow rate were altered to characterize their relative impact on capillary trapping. Computed x-ray microtomography (microCT) was used to quantify immobilized nonwetting fluid volumes after imbibition and drainage events. MicroCT-analyzed data suggests that capillary trapping in sintered glass bead (a mildly consolidated porous medium) is dictated by the capillary number (Ca), the viscosity ratio (M), and the Bond number (Bo) of the system, reflecting that all three viscous, capillary, and gravity forces affect the displacement process to varying degree as their relative importance changes. The amount of residual trapped nonwetting phase was observed to increase with increasing nonwetting fluid viscosity, and with decreasing density difference of the fluids; this suggests that CO2 sequestration can potentially be engineered for optimal trapping through alterations to the viscosity or density of supercritical CO2.",

The case without uncertainty is modelled with a perfect foresight (PF) model and with uncertainty with the real option approach (ROA). In this study, uncertainties in the CO2 price, tariff received per tonne of CO2 transported, the willingness, probability and moment that sources join the CO2 transportation network are incorporated in the analysis. The results show that uncertainty leads to higher required CO2 prices before investments in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are made. With a volatility of 47% in the CO2 price, the required CO2 price almost triples in comparison with the net present value approach. Hence, under uncertainty less sources are retrofitted with CCS and less CO2 is captured and stored over time. For instance, for the analyzed case study 31 Mt and 137 Mt CO2 is projected to be captured in the base scenario of ROA and PF model, respectively, in the period 2015\u20132050. If the volatility of the CO2 price is reduced with 50%, 96 Mt is projected to be captured in the ROA, which is still about one third less than in the PF model. Furthermore, the results show that uncertainty leads to less development of trunklines. All this leads to an increase in the transport and storage costs. For instance, for our case study, the average CO2 transport and storage costs in 2050 increase from 2.8 \u20ac/t to 13 \u20ac/t in the base scenario of the ROA compared to the PF model. If the volatility is reduced with 50%, the transport and storage costs decrease to 7.5 \u20ac/t in the ROA, which is still 2.5 times as much as in the PF model. Our findings indicate that the implementation of CCS can best be stimulated by reducing the volatility of the CO2 price, reducing capture costs and facilitating cooperation between nearby sources.",

Cacao AFS in Bahia, Brazil, are comprised of cacao planted either with woody species such as Erythrina spp. and Gliricidia spp. or under tree canopies in natural forest, the latter being known as \u201ccabruca\u201d. The large amounts of leaf litter, roots, and woody material from shade species as well as cacao represent a substantial addition of C into these systems, most of which, following decomposition, is stored in the soil. The total C storage in the weathered Oxisols under cacao AFS in Bahia is estimated as 302 Mg ha\u22121 to 1 m depth. Occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Therefore it is important to know the amount of soil C storage across different soil aggregate classes at different soil depths and identify the extent of the sequestered C that is occluded in the soil aggregates. Furthermore, the deep-rooted nature of cacao and shade trees makes it imperative to look below the surface soil, where most conventional soil studies are focused. Carbon sequestration potential of cacao and other shaded-perennial-crop-based AFS could be a source of income for the farmers of these crops, the majority of whom are smallholders. Understanding the mechanisms of soil C sequestration could lead to proper realization of this potential through better management options.",

The base case is a 660 MWe PCC-retrofitted power plant operating at 100% capacity and 90% capture rate in Australia. This is repowered by a solar thermal plant consisting of (a) a parabolic trough solar collector field with 806,520 m2 aperture area, (b) a thermal storage system with 8 full load hours of thermal storage and (c) an auxiliary gas heating unit, ensuring the solar thermal plant provides the high pressure side feed water preheating duty at all times without requirement to withdraw any steam from the power plant turbine circuit. A total of 230 MWth is provided from the solar thermal plant installation, being 100% supply for high pressure and intermediate feed water preheaters duty plus a surplus of 30% for maintaining the deaerator operation. A key feature here is trying to eliminate the frequent changes to the steam flow rate in the turbine circuit for solar feed water preheating and thus promoting ease of retrofit of repowering technology to PCC-retrofitted power plants. Details of the component sizing and modelling of solar thermal installation are provided and control and operating schemes are identified and analysed. A comprehensive dynamic model in TRNSYS dynamic modelling software is developed and used to analyse the solar thermal plant dynamic responses to external disturbances including climatic changes (Typical Meteorological data for Sydney is used). The analysis limitations and capabilities are highlighted. The model performance for month December is assessed showing its full capability to track the changes from power plant duty requirement and meteorological data within the time lapse of 0.01 s.",

Each treatment step, including transportation and waste disposal, generates economic and engineering challenges and risks; these steps should be factored into a comprehensive assessment. We expand the water treatment model (WTM) coupled within the sequestration system model CO2-PENS and use chemistry data from seawater and proposed injection sites in Wyoming, to demonstrate the relative importance of different water types on costs, including little-studied effects of organic pretreatment and transportation. We compare the WTM with an engineering water treatment model, utilizing energy costs and transportation costs. Specific energy costs for treatment of Madison Formation brackish and saline base cases and for seawater compared closely between the two models, with moderate differences for scenarios incorporating energy recovery. Transportation costs corresponded for all but low flow scenarios (<5000 m3/d). Some processes that have high costs (e.g., truck transportation) do not contribute the most variance to overall costs. Other factors, including feed-water temperature and water storage costs, are more significant contributors to variance.

                                        "abstract": "Extraction and treatment of in situ water can minimize risk for large-scale CO2 injection in saline aquifers during carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Additionally, treatment and reuse of oil and gas produced waters for hydraulic fracturing will conserve scarce fresh-water resources. Each treatment step, including transportation and waste disposal, generates economic and engineering challenges and risks; these steps should be factored into a comprehensive assessment. We expand the water treatment model (WTM) coupled within the sequestration system model CO2-PENS and use chemistry data from seawater and proposed injection sites in Wyoming, to demonstrate the relative importance of different water types on costs, including little-studied effects of organic pretreatment and transportation. We compare the WTM with an engineering water treatment model, utilizing energy costs and transportation costs. Specific energy costs for treatment of Madison Formation brackish and saline base cases and for seawater compared closely between the two models, with moderate differences for scenarios incorporating energy recovery. Transportation costs corresponded for all but low flow scenarios (<5000 m3/d). Some processes that have high costs (e.g., truck transportation) do not contribute the most variance to overall costs. Other factors, including feed-water temperature and water storage costs, are more significant contributors to variance. These results imply that the WTM can provide good estimates of treatment and related process costs (AACEI equivalent level 5, concept screening, or level 4, study or feasibility), and the complex relationships between processes when extracted waters are evaluated for use during CCUS and EOR site development.",

The model was developed for H2 production from UCG-based syngas with and without CCS, along with the co-production of electricity and steam in a conventional combined cycle plant. In this paper, at base case conditions (H2O-to-O2 injection ratio of 2 and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3), the coal-to-H2 conversion efficiency is estimated to be 58.1% for UCG with and without CCS. For the plant configuration involving no CCS, in addition to H2 production, approximately 4.7% of coal energy is converted to electricity that is exported to the grid. In the case of UCG\u2013CCS, a minor energy penalty is incurred; wherein the electrical energy exported per unit coal energy is around 2.4%, with a CO2 capture efficiency of 91.6% being achieved. The H2 conversion efficiency decreases with rise in H2O-to-O2 injection ratio, but increases with fall in steam-to-carbon ratio. Effect of ground water influx in UCG on the H2 conversion efficiency is minor, whereas H2 separation efficiency in the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit has a major effect.",

                                        "abstract": "Chemical looping and calcium (Ca) looping are two new technologies that can be used under a wide variety of process conditions to supply oxygen or remove carbon dioxide (CO2), respectively. Both technologies use high-temperature solid sorbents that are capable of being regenerated and are therefore used for many cycles. Both technologies have been extensively studied for combustion applications. Chemical looping combustion can be used in any situation in which pure high-temperature O2 is required, such as reforming or gasification, or in the case of Ca looping in which high-temperature CO2 removal is desired. Moreover, both technologies can be used either in fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reactors. Their use in reforming applications and hydrogen production has steadily received attention from the research community, and both technologies are reaching the level of large pilot plant status (1\u20133\u00a0MWth), moving them from bench scale to potential near-commercial application (technical readiness levels of 5 or 6). The possibility of using both technologies in combination is also receiving attention because it offers the potential for supplying pure oxygen without using cryogenic air separation with in situ CO2 removal.",

The projected later phases of work includes the injection of CO2 for field research to test and deploy elements of the sequestration technology, and to expand the understanding of different geological formations where very large quantities of CO2 may be stored longer-term. The basic data for sources sinks and transportation is linked together, along with other information in a geographic information system (GIS). All of the sequestration elements require assessments for their regional suitability as they concern technical and economic feasibility, social and political acceptance, legal and regulatory conditions, and other criteria. The very long-term nature of sequestration and the very large volumes of CO2 need to be stored and monitored make it likely that the assessments and data refinements will continue far beyond the 18-month schedule for the project.",

We use recent cost estimates for future fusion power plants in order to incorporate fusion into the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a long-term energy and environment model used to study the interaction between technology, climate, and public policy. Results show that fusion's growth will depend on: the chosen carbon mitigation target (if any); the availability of competing carbon-neutral options for the provision of baseload electrical power, in particular nuclear fission as well as carbon capture and storage; the chosen discount rate; the initial year of availability; and the assumed costs of fusion electricity. We quantify the present value of the fusion option while varying the assumptions about these other parameters, and we find that it is, in general for our range of assumptions, significantly larger than the estimated cost of a comprehensive R&D plan to develop fusion energy. The results emphasize the wisdom in hedging against uncertainty in future technology availability by pursuing the development of multiple options that could feasibly play a major role in the latter half of the century.",

Considering that the exposure may cause damage to public health, it seems inevitable that if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve for the management of the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment, and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries. While none are exact analogs, as a whole, the set offers variation in key variables critical for determining the success of carbon sequestration as a viable climate policy option.",

                                        "abstract": "The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model, developed at Argonne National Laboratory, has been expanded to include well-to-wake (WTWa) analysis of aviation fuels and aircraft. This report documents the key WTWa stages and assumptions for fuels that represent alternatives to petroleum jet fuel. The aviation module in GREET consists of three spreadsheets that present detailed characterizations of well-to-pump and pump-to-wake parameters and WTWa results. By using the expanded GREET version (GREET1_2011), we estimate WTWa results for energy use (total, fossil, and petroleum energy) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) for (1) each unit of energy (lower heating value) consumed by the aircraft or(2) each unit of distance traveled/ payload carried by the aircraft. The fuel pathways considered in this analysis include petroleum-based jet fuel from conventional and unconventional sources (i.e., oil sands); Fisher-Tropsch (FT) jet fuel from natural gas, coal, and biomass; bio-jet fuel from fast pyrolysis of cellulosic biomass; and bio-jet fuel from vegetable and algal oils, which falls under the American Society for Testing and Materials category of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids. For aircraft operation, we considered six passenger aircraft classes and four freight aircraft classes in this analysis. Our analysis revealed that, depending on the feedstock source, the fuel conversion technology, and the allocation or displacement credit methodology applied to co-products, alternative bio-jet fuel pathways have the potential to reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 55\u201385 percent compared with conventional (petroleum-based) jet fuel. Although producing FT jet fuel from fossil feedstock sources \u2014 such as natural gas and coal \u2014 could greatly reduce dependence on crude oil, production from such sources (especially coal) produces greater WTWa GHG emissions compared with petroleum jet fuel production unless carbon management practices, such as carbon capture and storage, are used.",

                                        "abstract": "Recent modeling efforts strongly suggest that carbon capture and sequestration technologies will begin deploying in the relatively near future and will, by the middle of the century, be a significant aspect of the global energy infrastructure with the technology deploying in virtually every part of the world. Large scale penetration of this technology into the marketplace\u2014perhaps as much as 30% of all climate mitigation by the end of this century could be attributable to this one class of technologies\u2014allows society to significantly control the cost of addressing climate change. There is a growing body of literature that points to the significant potential of carbon capture and sequestration technologies to help society address the challenge posed by climate change. In particular, carbon capture and sequestration appears to be a fundamental key to controlling the costs of addressing climate change. Within this literature, there is also speculation that the retention of CO 2 in sequestration reservoirs might be less than 100% effective in isolating CO 2 from the atmosphere. The intent of this chapter is to explore tolerable levels of leakage, the economic value of \"low or no-leakage\" reservoirs to society and industry, and the implications of retention on the design of a near-term R&D portfolio.",

                                        "abstract": "Existing monitoring protocols for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in geologic formations are provided by carbon dioxide capture and geological storage (CCS)-specific regulations and bodies including the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the European Union (EU) CCS and Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Directives, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Final Rules, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Modalities and Procedures (for developing countries). These protocols have varying levels of detail but similar principles and requirements for monitoring, and all include the need to quantify emissions and measure environmental impacts in the event of leakage to the surface. What they do not all include is the clarification that quantification monitoring should only be undertaken in cases where CO2 has been attributed to leakage and not when leakage is only suspected. Quantifying suspected emissions is a significant monitoring challenge and undertaking, and may rely on acquiring large data sets over long time periods. This level of effort in monitoring would be unnecessary if the source of CO2 detected at the surface is attributed to natural sources rather than from leakage, but a step to attribute CO2 source is either missing from these protocols or is outdated in technical scope. Regulatory bodies call for protocols to be updated based on technical advances, and ongoing technical advances into leakage monitoring have now benefited from a first-ever public claim of leakage over a geologic CO2 storage site in Saskatchewan, Canada, bringing more emphasis on the role of attribution monitoring. We present a brief update of some of the newest technical advances in attribution and suggest that CO2 \u2018attribution monitoring\u2019 could now be included in monitoring protocols to avoid unnecessary and costly quantification monitoring unless it is fully warranted. In this context, this paper describes an option to improve the existing protocols for monitoring CO2 at geological storage sites made possible because of recent developments in near-surface attribution monitoring techniques.",

                                        "abstract": "Existing monitoring protocols for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in geologic formations are provided by carbon dioxide capture and geological storage (CCS)-specific regulations and bodies including the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the European Union (EU) CCS and Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Directives, United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Final Rules, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Modalities and Procedures (for developing countries). These protocols have varying levels of detail but similar principles and requirements for monitoring, and all include the need to quantify emissions and measure environmental impacts in the event of leakage to the surface. What they do not all include is the clarification that quantification monitoring should only be undertaken in cases where CO2 has been attributed to leakage and not when leakage is only suspected. Quantifying suspected emissions is a significant monitoring challenge and undertaking, and may rely on acquiring large data sets over long time periods. This level of effort in monitoring would be unnecessary if the source of CO2 detected at the surface is attributed to natural sources rather than from leakage, but a step to attribute CO2 source is either missing from these protocols or is outdated in technical scope. Regulatory bodies call for protocols to be updated based on technical advances, and ongoing technical advances into leakage monitoring have now benefited from a first-ever public claim of leakage over a geologic CO2 storage site in Saskatchewan, Canada, bringing more emphasis on the role of attribution monitoring. We present a brief update of some of the newest technical advances in attribution and suggest that CO2 \u2018attribution monitoring\u2019 could now be included in monitoring protocols to avoid unnecessary and costly quantification monitoring unless it is fully warranted. In this context, this paper describes an option to improve the existing protocols for monitoring CO2 at geological storage sites made possible because of recent developments in near-surface attribution monitoring techniques.",

Specifically, titanate nanotubes with reticulation structure were employed as optoelectronic element, which possessed fine photocatalytic activity and enhancement in facilitating fast and long-distance electron transport. Hierarchical-structured carbon nanohorns were introduced as the mainstay to provide as the electron-transport medium to capture and transmit electrons from excited titanate nanotubes to the sensing matrix owing to the prominent conductivity and large surface. Furthermore, the holes from valence band of stimulated titanate nanotubes could transfer to their surface and be consumed by folic acid, thus enhancing the photocurrent response.

The model was developed for H2 production from UCG-based syngas with and without CCS, along with the co-production of electricity and steam in a conventional combined cycle plant. In this paper, at base case conditions (H2O-to-O2 injection ratio of 2 and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3), the coal-to-H2 conversion efficiency is estimated to be 58.1% for UCG with and without CCS. For the plant configuration involving no CCS, in addition to H2 production, approximately 4.7% of coal energy is converted to electricity that is exported to the grid. In the case of UCG\u2013CCS, a minor energy penalty is incurred; wherein the electrical energy exported per unit coal energy is around 2.4%, with a CO2 capture efficiency of 91.6% being achieved. The H2 conversion efficiency decreases with rise in H2O-to-O2 injection ratio, but increases with fall in steam-to-carbon ratio. Effect of ground water influx in UCG on the H2 conversion efficiency is minor, whereas H2 separation efficiency in the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit has a major effect.",

The penetration of distributed generation (DG) at medium and low voltages is increasing in developed countries worldwide. Microgrids are entities that coordinate DERs (distributed energy resources) in a consistently more decentralized way, thereby reducing the control burden on the grid and permitting them to provide their full benefits. In the context of this article, a microgrid comprises a LV locally-controlled cluster of DERs that behaves, from the grid's perspective, as a single producer or both electrically and in energy markets. A microgrid operates safely and efficiently within its local distribution network, but it is also capable of islanding.",

                                        "abstract": "Publisher Summary Commercial biomass is a technology that is of interest in the context of the formulation of a response to the issue of climate change, because it is a potential source of modern commercial fuels in which the carbon content of the fuel was originally obtained from the air. Thus, biomass has no net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most prominent greenhouse gas. Biomass must compete with well established energy forms, in addition to other emerging energy technologies, for market share. To win a significant market share, biomass technology must continue to improve. The degree of improvement will have a major influence on the role of biotechnology in addressing climate change. This chapter examines the competition among technologies in a variety of markets, and explores conditions under which new markets for modern commercial biologically derived fuels could emerge. Important interactions with agricultural markets and land use and land cover have been considered. The successful application of biotechnology to crop, pasture, and forest productivities has been shown to be important. The availability of a complimentary energy technology like carbon capture and disposal technologies has been shown to dramatically reduce the cost of stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases, as well as to open up the possibility of negative-emission energy production from biomass.",

Thus, biomass has no net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most prominent greenhouse gas. Biomass must compete with well established energy forms, in addition to other emerging energy technologies, for market share. To win a significant market share, biomass technology must continue to improve. The degree of improvement will have a major influence on the role of biotechnology in addressing climate change. This chapter examines the competition among technologies in a variety of markets, and explores conditions under which new markets for modern commercial biologically derived fuels could emerge. Important interactions with agricultural markets and land use and land cover have been considered. The successful application of biotechnology to crop, pasture, and forest productivities has been shown to be important. The availability of a complimentary energy technology like carbon capture and disposal technologies has been shown to dramatically reduce the cost of stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases, as well as to open up the possibility of negative-emission energy production from biomass.",

Tropical forests of north Queensland, Australia, are highly sensitive to climate change and substantial shifts in the distribution of these forests are likely to occur with minor variations in climate. The focus of this research was the development of a model-based system for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and predicting the impacts of climate change on these dynamics. This paper presents the parameterisation and calibration of (a) the 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) model to a selection of restored rainforest and commercial timber plantations and (b) a modified version 3-PGS which uses satellite data, enabling the spatial assessment of mature tropical rainforest growth and production throughout the wet tropics bioregion. Statistically significant relationships were observed between 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled and field measured estimates of stand structural attributes including, basal area (BA), diameter at breast height (DBH) and above-ground biomass (AGB) throughout the bioregion. 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled leaf area index (LAI) and net primary production (NPP) related well to published estimates at other similar rainforest sites. These results indicate that the simple, process-based models are effective at capturing the growth dynamics of structurally complex old-growth, restoration and plantation rainforests.",

                                        "abstract": "Accurate information concerning regional to ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics within tropical rainforests is important because of the increasing certainty that the global climate will change significantly within the next century. Tropical forests of north Queensland, Australia, are highly sensitive to climate change and substantial shifts in the distribution of these forests are likely to occur with minor variations in climate. The focus of this research was the development of a model-based system for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and predicting the impacts of climate change on these dynamics. This paper presents the parameterisation and calibration of (a) the 3-PG (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) model to a selection of restored rainforest and commercial timber plantations and (b) a modified version 3-PGS which uses satellite data, enabling the spatial assessment of mature tropical rainforest growth and production throughout the wet tropics bioregion. Statistically significant relationships were observed between 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled and field measured estimates of stand structural attributes including, basal area (BA), diameter at breast height (DBH) and above-ground biomass (AGB) throughout the bioregion. 3-PG and 3-PGS modelled leaf area index (LAI) and net primary production (NPP) related well to published estimates at other similar rainforest sites. These results indicate that the simple, process-based models are effective at capturing the growth dynamics of structurally complex old-growth, restoration and plantation rainforests.",

It provides an initial examination of the consequence of regionally disaggregated demand for, and supply of, CO2-storage reservoirs within the context of a globally disaggregated, long-term analysis of both the geology and economics of capture and storage (CCS). It is suggested that some regions see their ability to deploy CCS systems constrained by a lack of quality target reservoirs relative to major sources in that region. Other regions appear to have sufficient storage capacity to easily carry them through the 21st century. It also examines the degree to which the relative abundance of CCS opportunities in a region influences the adoption of other emissions-mitigation technologies.

Highly fluorescent C-Dots were synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal reaction, with citric acid serving as the carbon source and ethylene diamine acting as the nitrogen source. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain the desired surface functionality. Then, the C-Dots were used to label one member of the anti-AFP pair (Ab2) via amine-amine coupling using glutaraldehyde. The capture anti-AFP (Ab1) was coated onto polystyrene well plates and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to block unsaturated binding sites. AFP was incubated in Ab1-coated wells; unbound AFP was then washed away with Tween-20. Next, the C-Dot-labeled Ab2 was added to form a sandwich immunocomplex with the AFP bound to the Ab1-coated wells. The fluorescence intensities detected from the C-Dots on these sandwich immunocomplexes were positively correlated to the concentrations of AFP antigen. A five-parameter logistic regression calibration curve was established between fluorescence and clinically important AFP concentrations (range: 0-350 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of R(2) = 0.995). The results from the C-Dot-based immunoassay were in agreement with results from traditional immunoassays, which used horseradish peroxidase (HRP, R(2) = 0.964) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, R(2) = 0.973). These results indicated that C-Dots have great potential to be applied as biolabels for high-throughput well-plate-based immunoassays.",

Highly fluorescent C-Dots were synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal reaction, with citric acid serving as the carbon source and ethylene diamine acting as the nitrogen source. The reaction conditions were optimized to obtain the desired surface functionality. Then, the C-Dots were used to label one member of the anti-AFP pair (Ab2) via amine-amine coupling using glutaraldehyde. The capture anti-AFP (Ab1) was coated onto polystyrene well plates and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to block unsaturated binding sites. AFP was incubated in Ab1-coated wells; unbound AFP was then washed away with Tween-20. Next, the C-Dot-labeled Ab2 was added to form a sandwich immunocomplex with the AFP bound to the Ab1-coated wells. The fluorescence intensities detected from the C-Dots on these sandwich immunocomplexes were positively correlated to the concentrations of AFP antigen. A five-parameter logistic regression calibration curve was established between fluorescence and clinically important AFP concentrations (range: 0-350 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of R(2) = 0.995). The results from the C-Dot-based immunoassay were in agreement with results from traditional immunoassays, which used horseradish peroxidase (HRP, R(2) = 0.964) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, R(2) = 0.973). These results indicated that C-Dots have great potential to be applied as biolabels for high-throughput well-plate-based immunoassays.",

                                        "abstract": "There is a knowledge gap on biochar carbon (C) longevity and its priming effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and recent root-derived C under field conditions. This knowledge would allow the potential of biochar in long-term soil C sequestration to be established. However, most studies on biochar C longevity and its priming effect have been undertaken in plant-free laboratory incubations. A 388 d field study was carried out in the presence of an annual ryegrass (C3) growing on a rhodic ferralsol with established C3/C4 plant-derived SOC (\u03b413C: \u221220.2\u2030) in a subtropical climate. A 13C-depleted hardwood biochar (\u03b413C: \u221235.7\u2030, produced at 450 \u00b0C) was applied at 0 and 30 dry t ha\u22121 and mixed into the top 100-mm soil profile (equivalent to 3% w/w). We report on the differentiation and quantification of root respiration and mineralisation of soil-C and biochar-C in the field. Periodic 13CO2 pulse labelling was applied to enrich \u03b413C of root respiration during two separate winter campaigns (\u03b413C: 151.5\u2013184.6\u2030) and one summer campaign (\u03b413C: 19.8\u201331.5\u2030). Combined soil plus root respiration was separated from leaf respiration using a novel in-field respiration collar. A two-pool isotope mixing model was applied to partition three C sources (i.e. root, biochar and soil). Three scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity associated with the C source partitioning in the planted systems: 1) extreme positive priming of recent SOC derived from the current ryegrass (C3) pasture; 2) equivalent magnitude of priming of SOC and labile root C; and 3) extreme positive priming of the native C4-dominant SOC. We showed that biochar induced a significant negative priming of SOC in the presence of growing plants but no net priming was observed in the unplanted soil. We also demonstrated the importance of experimental timeframe in capturing the transient nature of biochar-induced priming, from positive (day 0\u201362) to negative (day 62\u2013388). The presence/absence of plants had no impact on biochar-C mineralisation in this ferralsol during the measurement period. Based on a two-pool exponential model, the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar varied from 351 to 449 years in the intensive pasture system to 415\u2013484 years in the unplanted soils.",

A 13C-depleted hardwood biochar (\u03b413C: \u221235.7\u2030, produced at 450 \u00b0C) was applied at 0 and 30 dry t ha\u22121 and mixed into the top 100-mm soil profile (equivalent to 3% w/w). We report on the differentiation and quantification of root respiration and mineralisation of soil-C and biochar-C in the field. Periodic 13CO2 pulse labelling was applied to enrich \u03b413C of root respiration during two separate winter campaigns (\u03b413C: 151.5\u2013184.6\u2030) and one summer campaign (\u03b413C: 19.8\u201331.5\u2030). Combined soil plus root respiration was separated from leaf respiration using a novel in-field respiration collar. A two-pool isotope mixing model was applied to partition three C sources (i.e. root, biochar and soil). Three scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity associated with the C source partitioning in the planted systems: 1) extreme positive priming of recent SOC derived from the current ryegrass (C3) pasture; 2) equivalent magnitude of priming of SOC and labile root C; and 3) extreme positive priming of the native C4-dominant SOC. We showed that biochar induced a significant negative priming of SOC in the presence of growing plants but no net priming was observed in the unplanted soil. We also demonstrated the importance of experimental timeframe in capturing the transient nature of biochar-induced priming, from positive (day 0\u201362) to negative (day 62\u2013388). The presence/absence of plants had no impact on biochar-C mineralisation in this ferralsol during the measurement period. Based on a two-pool exponential model, the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar varied from 351 to 449 years in the intensive pasture system to 415\u2013484 years in the unplanted soils.",

                                        "abstract": "Abstract This paper focuses on the CFD simulation of a CFB pilot-scale carbonator of a 1\u00a0MW th DFB installation located at TU Darmstadt (TUD). The carbonator riser height and diameter are 8.661\u00a0m and 590\u00a0mm, respectively. The state-of-the-art TFM approach is applied while the inter-phase drag coefficient is simulated using a new configuration of the sub-grid EMMS drag model. This configuration incorporates a new approach for the determination of the clusters diameter taking into account the geometrical limitations that the riser diameter poses to the meso-scale structures. The conventional Gidaspow model and the EMMS scheme are tested simultaneously along with the grid density effect. Two mesh densities, one coarse, and one dense are applied, i.e. 31,207 and 285,369 hexahedral elements. The mean ratio of the equivalent cell size to particles diameter ( D cell / D p ) is 465.64 and 222.67, respectively. Except for the grid density effect on the solution results, the wall treatment boundary conditions are investigated, as far as particulates are concerned, through a parametric study on the specularity coefficient values (0.01, 0.1, 0.6 and 0.99) implemented in the partial slip model. Finally, the heterogeneous carbonation reaction is incorporated to the model and a study of the influence of the hydrodynamics on the carbon dioxide capture is investigated. Simulation results are averaged over a time period of 15\u00a0s, while the pressure measurements are compared with the corresponding experimental data. Results for pressure converge well with the experimental results for pressure measurements along the riser, when the EMMS model is applied, while it is worth mentioning that this drag model reproduced an almost grid independent solution. For the CO 2 concentration at the riser exit, the averaged for 65\u00a0s value converges well with the respective measured value.",

Both of these stars belong to the sub-class CEMP-s, and exhibit clear over-abundances of heavy elements associated with production by the slow neutron-capture process. HD196944 has been well-studied in the optical region, but we are able to add abundance results for six species (Ge, Nb, Mo, Lu, Pt, and Au) that are only accessible in the NUV. In addition, we provide the first determination of its orbital period, P=1325 days. HD201626 has only a limited number of abundance results based on previous optical work -- here we add five new species from the NUV, including Pb. We compare these results with models of binary-system evolution and s-process element production in stars on the asymptotic giant branch, aiming to explain their origin and evolution. Our best-fitting models for HD 196944 (M1,i = 0.9Mo, M2,i = 0.86Mo, for [Fe/H]=-2.2), and HD 201626 (M1,i = 0.9Mo , M2,i = 0.76Mo , for [Fe/H]=-2.2; M1,i = 1.6Mo , M2,i = 0.59Mo, for [Fe/H]=-1.5) are consistent with the current accepted scenario for the formation of CEMP-s stars.",

                                        "abstract": "We present an elemental-abundance analysis, in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectral range, for the bright carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars HD196944 (V = 8.40, [Fe/H] = -2.41) and HD201626 (V = 8.16, [Fe/H] = -1.51), based on data acquired with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Both of these stars belong to the sub-class CEMP-s, and exhibit clear over-abundances of heavy elements associated with production by the slow neutron-capture process. HD196944 has been well-studied in the optical region, but we are able to add abundance results for six species (Ge, Nb, Mo, Lu, Pt, and Au) that are only accessible in the NUV. In addition, we provide the first determination of its orbital period, P=1325 days. HD201626 has only a limited number of abundance results based on previous optical work -- here we add five new species from the NUV, including Pb. We compare these results with models of binary-system evolution and s-process element production in stars on the asymptotic giant branch, aiming to explain their origin and evolution. Our best-fitting models for HD 196944 (M1,i = 0.9Mo, M2,i = 0.86Mo, for [Fe/H]=-2.2), and HD 201626 (M1,i = 0.9Mo , M2,i = 0.76Mo , for [Fe/H]=-2.2; M1,i = 1.6Mo , M2,i = 0.59Mo, for [Fe/H]=-1.5) are consistent with the current accepted scenario for the formation of CEMP-s stars.",

                                        "abstract": "We present an elemental-abundance analysis, in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectral range, for the bright carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars HD196944 (V = 8.40, [Fe/H] = -2.41) and HD201626 (V = 8.16, [Fe/H] = -1.51), based on data acquired with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Both of these stars belong to the sub-class CEMP-s, and exhibit clear over-abundances of heavy elements associated with production by the slow neutron-capture process. HD196944 has been well-studied in the optical region, but we are able to add abundance results for six species (Ge, Nb, Mo, Lu, Pt, and Au) that are only accessible in the NUV. In addition, we provide the first determination of its orbital period, P=1325 days. HD201626 has only a limited number of abundance results based on previous optical work -- here we add five new species from the NUV, including Pb. We compare these results with models of binary-system evolution and s-process element production in stars on the asymptotic giant branch, aiming to explain their origin and evolution. Our best-fitting models for HD 196944 (M1,i = 0.9Mo, M2,i = 0.86Mo, for [Fe/H]=-2.2), and HD 201626 (M1,i = 0.9Mo , M2,i = 0.76Mo , for [Fe/H]=-2.2; M1,i = 1.6Mo , M2,i = 0.59Mo, for [Fe/H]=-1.5) are consistent with the current accepted scenario for the formation of CEMP-s stars.",

This report documents the key WTWa stages and assumptions for fuels that represent alternatives to petroleum jet fuel. The aviation module in GREET consists of three spreadsheets that present detailed characterizations of well-to-pump and pump-to-wake parameters and WTWa results. By using the expanded GREET version (GREET1_2011), we estimate WTWa results for energy use (total, fossil, and petroleum energy) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) for (1) each unit of energy (lower heating value) consumed by the aircraft or(2) each unit of distance traveled/ payload carried by the aircraft. The fuel pathways considered in this analysis include petroleum-based jet fuel from conventional and unconventional sources (i.e., oil sands); Fisher-Tropsch (FT) jet fuel from natural gas, coal, and biomass; bio-jet fuel from fast pyrolysis of cellulosic biomass; and bio-jet fuel from vegetable and algal oils, which falls under the American Society for Testing and Materials category of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids. For aircraft operation, we considered six passenger aircraft classes and four freight aircraft classes in this analysis. Our analysis revealed that, depending on the feedstock source, the fuel conversion technology, and the allocation or displacement credit methodology applied to co-products, alternative bio-jet fuel pathways have the potential to reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 55\u201385 percent compared with conventional (petroleum-based) jet fuel. Although producing FT jet fuel from fossil feedstock sources \u2014 such as natural gas and coal \u2014 could greatly reduce dependence on crude oil, production from such sources (especially coal) produces greater WTWa GHG emissions compared with petroleum jet fuel production unless carbon management practices, such as carbon capture and storage, are used.",

                                        "abstract": "The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model, developed at Argonne National Laboratory, has been expanded to include well-to-wake (WTWa) analysis of aviation fuels and aircraft. This report documents the key WTWa stages and assumptions for fuels that represent alternatives to petroleum jet fuel. The aviation module in GREET consists of three spreadsheets that present detailed characterizations of well-to-pump and pump-to-wake parameters and WTWa results. By using the expanded GREET version (GREET1_2011), we estimate WTWa results for energy use (total, fossil, and petroleum energy) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) for (1) each unit of energy (lower heating value) consumed by the aircraft or(2) each unit of distance traveled/ payload carried by the aircraft. The fuel pathways considered in this analysis include petroleum-based jet fuel from conventional and unconventional sources (i.e., oil sands); Fisher-Tropsch (FT) jet fuel from natural gas, coal, and biomass; bio-jet fuel from fast pyrolysis of cellulosic biomass; and bio-jet fuel from vegetable and algal oils, which falls under the American Society for Testing and Materials category of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids. For aircraft operation, we considered six passenger aircraft classes and four freight aircraft classes in this analysis. Our analysis revealed that, depending on the feedstock source, the fuel conversion technology, and the allocation or displacement credit methodology applied to co-products, alternative bio-jet fuel pathways have the potential to reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 55\u201385 percent compared with conventional (petroleum-based) jet fuel. Although producing FT jet fuel from fossil feedstock sources \u2014 such as natural gas and coal \u2014 could greatly reduce dependence on crude oil, production from such sources (especially coal) produces greater WTWa GHG emissions compared with petroleum jet fuel production unless carbon management practices, such as carbon capture and storage, are used.",

Conventional design practices focus on implementing incremental expansions based on deterministic requirements resulting in rigid networks. The design approaches do not proactively recognize future uncertainties in design requirements and operating environments. In this study, we present a design method based on real options, graph theory and Monte Carlo techniques that reckons future uncertainties. The proposed method assesses initial design architectures and provides insights into potential real options and sets of strategies for implementing future expansions. We apply the method to a hypothetical CCS network design. The results reveal that this method helps to appraise the flexibility created by redundant pipe capacity and length in an uncertain future. It also shows that embedding real options in expanding CCS networks could result in more emission reduction by encouraging other emitters to participate.",

                                        "abstract": "The evolution and timing of the inception of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) has been one of the most debated climatic mysteries amongst climate workers. The Himalaya\u2013Tibetan plateau (HTP) complex has been implicated as the main driver for SAM circulation. However, there are intense debates as to whether there was a critical elevation of the HTP complex that drove the SAM and at what time such a critical elevation was attained. Also, the role of the HTP complex in driving the SAM has been questioned in recent climate model studies. The model simulation suggests a major intensification of the SAM as early as ~ 30 Ma, whereas marine records from the Arabian Sea indicate a major strengthening of the South Asian summer or southwest monsoon winds between 10 and 8 Ma. The continental vegetation, on the other hand, captured a major transition from C3 to C4 type during 8\u20137 Ma but whether this change was local or global and whether this transition was driven by monsoonal precipitation is not unanimously accepted. Our new record from Ocean Drilling Program holes located off the Oman margin and on the Owen Ridge, western Arabian Sea shows appearance of monsoon wind proxy planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides, a significant increase in total organic carbon, and a negative shift in stable carbon isotope record of benthic foraminifera at ~ 12.9 Ma. These proxies indicate that present day South Asian monsoon wind system began to develop during the late Middle Miocene (~ 12.9 Ma) and summer monsoon was in its full strength in the late Miocene (~ 7 Ma). From 11 to 7 Ma, the summer monsoon was weaker when winter monsoon was stronger.",

The Himalaya\u2013Tibetan plateau (HTP) complex has been implicated as the main driver for SAM circulation. However, there are intense debates as to whether there was a critical elevation of the HTP complex that drove the SAM and at what time such a critical elevation was attained. Also, the role of the HTP complex in driving the SAM has been questioned in recent climate model studies. The model simulation suggests a major intensification of the SAM as early as ~ 30 Ma, whereas marine records from the Arabian Sea indicate a major strengthening of the South Asian summer or southwest monsoon winds between 10 and 8 Ma. The continental vegetation, on the other hand, captured a major transition from C3 to C4 type during 8\u20137 Ma but whether this change was local or global and whether this transition was driven by monsoonal precipitation is not unanimously accepted. Our new record from Ocean Drilling Program holes located off the Oman margin and on the Owen Ridge, western Arabian Sea shows appearance of monsoon wind proxy planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides, a significant increase in total organic carbon, and a negative shift in stable carbon isotope record of benthic foraminifera at ~ 12.9 Ma. These proxies indicate that present day South Asian monsoon wind system began to develop during the late Middle Miocene (~ 12.9 Ma) and summer monsoon was in its full strength in the late Miocene (~ 7 Ma). From 11 to 7 Ma, the summer monsoon was weaker when winter monsoon was stronger.",

Portable systems and those that can be carried are also currently being designed for civilian and military markets. Fuel cells are capable of generating electricity with virtually negligible to zero pollution (e.g. SOx, NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matters (PMs)). They also offer a reduced carbon footprint and have the potential to be engineered for \u2018zero carbon\u2019 systems. Despite the potential to meet the pressing needs for clean and efficient fuel cell\u2013based power generation systems, high capital and maintenance cost remains a challenge for large-scale commercialisation and global market entry. Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most promising fuel cell technologies as it offers significantly higher electrical efficiency as well as co-production of high-quality process heat. The system lifetime, its reliability and cost, however, remain a concern due to the performance degradation with time, commonly associated with the instability of materials in complex operating environment and high exposure temperature (650\u20131000)\u00b0C. New materials, systems design and operating conditions are being developed to increase the lifetime. Centralised and distributed SOFC power systems in the range of hundreds of kilowatt to megawatt are being considered for integration with advanced coal power plants, hybrid systems integrated with energy storage and carbon-capture technologies to fully exploit the commercial potential.",

Remote sensing observations of seasonal canopy greenness dynamics represent a valuable means to study land surface phenology (LSP) at scales relevant for comparison with regional climate information as well as ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes. We explore relationships among key LSP dates at the start and end of the season captured by three remote sensing products (i.e., NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; PI: Phenology Index; MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) over 19 deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest sites in the northern hemisphere for 2000\u20132012, and compare these estimates to estimates of start and end of photosynthesis phenology extracted from gross primary productivity (GPP) from CO2 flux measurements. To derive phenological transition dates, we use analytical solutions of various derivatives from the fitted logistic curves. LSP dates estimated by the three remote sensing products were not equivalent and differed in their sign and magnitude of lags with photosynthesis phenology dates. NDVI-derived phenology was characterized by shorter growing seasons, while EVI prolonged it by about two weeks compared to the photosynthesis phenology season length. PI start and end of season dates more closely matched the start (r2 = 0.84, RMSE = 7.61) and end (r2 = 0.61, RMSE = 8.57) of photosynthesis phenology as estimated by GPP time series. PI was also found agreeing best with LSP estimates from highly spatially resolved ground digital camera observations, available for about half of the investigated FLUXNET sites. Although there were strong relationships between remotely sensed LSP and photosynthesis phenology, the relationships were not consistent across deciduous forest ecosystems implying that the vegetative and photosynthetic timing do not always follow each other in the same direction.",

Remote sensing observations of seasonal canopy greenness dynamics represent a valuable means to study land surface phenology (LSP) at scales relevant for comparison with regional climate information as well as ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes. We explore relationships among key LSP dates at the start and end of the season captured by three remote sensing products (i.e., NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; PI: Phenology Index; MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) over 19 deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest sites in the northern hemisphere for 2000\u20132012, and compare these estimates to estimates of start and end of photosynthesis phenology extracted from gross primary productivity (GPP) from CO2 flux measurements. To derive phenological transition dates, we use analytical solutions of various derivatives from the fitted logistic curves. LSP dates estimated by the three remote sensing products were not equivalent and differed in their sign and magnitude of lags with photosynthesis phenology dates. NDVI-derived phenology was characterized by shorter growing seasons, while EVI prolonged it by about two weeks compared to the photosynthesis phenology season length. PI start and end of season dates more closely matched the start (r2 = 0.84, RMSE = 7.61) and end (r2 = 0.61, RMSE = 8.57) of photosynthesis phenology as estimated by GPP time series. PI was also found agreeing best with LSP estimates from highly spatially resolved ground digital camera observations, available for about half of the investigated FLUXNET sites. Although there were strong relationships between remotely sensed LSP and photosynthesis phenology, the relationships were not consistent across deciduous forest ecosystems implying that the vegetative and photosynthetic timing do not always follow each other in the same direction.",

                                        "abstract": "Geological carbon sequestration is being considered worldwide as a means of mitigating anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases. During sequestration, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas effluent is captured from coal-fired power plants or other concentrated emission sources and injected into saline aquifers or depleted oil reservoirs for long term storage. In an effort to fully understand and optimize CO2 trapping efficiency, the capillary mechanisms that immobilize subsurface CO2 were analyzed at the pore-scale. Pairs of proxy fluids representing the potential range of in-situ conditions of supercritical CO2 (nonwetting fluid) and brine (wetting fluid) were used during experimentation. The two fluids were imbibed and drained from a flow cell apparatus containing a sintered glass bead core. Fluid parameters (such as interfacial tension and fluid viscosities) and flow rate were altered to characterize their relative impact on capillary trapping. Computed x-ray microtomography (microCT) was used to quantify immobilized nonwetting fluid volumes after imbibition and drainage events. MicroCT-analyzed data suggests that capillary trapping in sintered glass bead (a mildly consolidated porous medium) is dictated by the capillary number (Ca), the viscosity ratio (M), and the Bond number (Bo) of the system, reflecting that all three viscous, capillary, and gravity forces affect the displacement process to varying degree as their relative importance changes. The amount of residual trapped nonwetting phase was observed to increase with increasing nonwetting fluid viscosity, and with decreasing density difference of the fluids; this suggests that CO2 sequestration can potentially be engineered for optimal trapping through alterations to the viscosity or density of supercritical CO2.",

The production of energetic particles results in the formation of hot coronae that are made up of neutral atoms including hot carbon. Some of these atoms are on ballistic trajectories and return to the thermosphere, and others escape. Understanding the physics in this region requires modeling that captures the complicated dynamics of hot atoms in 3-D. This study evaluates the carbon atom inventory by investigating the production and distribution of energetic carbon atoms using the full 3-D atmospheric input. The methodology and details of the hot atomic carbon model calculation are given, and the calculated total global escape of hot carbon from the assumed dominant photochemical processes at a fixed condition, equinox (Ls\u2009=\u2009180\u00b0), and low solar activity (F10.7\u2009=\u200970 at Earth) are presented. To investigate the dynamics of these energetic neutral atoms, we have coupled a self-consistent 3-D global kinetic model, the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator, with a 3-D thermosphere/ionosphere model, the Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model to provide a self-consistent global description of the hot carbon corona in the upper thermosphere and exosphere. The spatial distributions of density and temperature and atmospheric loss are simulated for the case considered.",

                                        "abstract": "Two important source reactions for hot atomic carbon on Mars are photodissociation of CO and dissociative recombination of CO+; both reactions are highly sensitive to solar activity and occur mostly deep in the dayside thermosphere. The production of energetic particles results in the formation of hot coronae that are made up of neutral atoms including hot carbon. Some of these atoms are on ballistic trajectories and return to the thermosphere, and others escape. Understanding the physics in this region requires modeling that captures the complicated dynamics of hot atoms in 3-D. This study evaluates the carbon atom inventory by investigating the production and distribution of energetic carbon atoms using the full 3-D atmospheric input. The methodology and details of the hot atomic carbon model calculation are given, and the calculated total global escape of hot carbon from the assumed dominant photochemical processes at a fixed condition, equinox (Ls\u2009=\u2009180\u00b0), and low solar activity (F10.7\u2009=\u200970 at Earth) are presented. To investigate the dynamics of these energetic neutral atoms, we have coupled a self-consistent 3-D global kinetic model, the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator, with a 3-D thermosphere/ionosphere model, the Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model to provide a self-consistent global description of the hot carbon corona in the upper thermosphere and exosphere. The spatial distributions of density and temperature and atmospheric loss are simulated for the case considered.",

                                        "abstract": "Due to the rapid growth in demand for certain materials, compounded by political risks associated with the geographical concentration of the supply of them, a shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies. In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise the objectives of the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low-carbon energy technologies of SET-Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1% or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by-products (from the processing of other metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications.",

                                        "abstract": "Due to the rapid growth in demand for certain materials, compounded by political risks associated with the geographical concentration of the supply of them, a shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies. In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise the objectives of the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low-carbon energy technologies of SET-Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1% or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by-products (from the processing of other metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications.",

                                        "abstract": "The fundamental biophysical cause of stagnant per capita food production in Africa is soil fertility depletion. Because mineral fertilizers cost two to six times as much as those sold worldwide, a soil fertility replenishment approach has been developed based on naturally available resources: nitrogen-fixing leguminous tree fallows that accumulate 100 to 200 kg N ha, indigenous rock phosphate applications, and biomass transfers of the nutrient-accumulating shrub\n Tithonia diversifolia. Tens of thousands of farmers in East and Southern Africa are becoming food secure with these technologies. Soil fertility depletion must be addressed before other technologies and policies can become effective in overcoming hunger in Africa.",

Three different radiolabeled tracers were employed, [14,15-3H]LTE4, [35S]LTE4, and [14C] LTE4 in five separate infusion studies. There was a rapid disappearance of radioactivity from the vascular compartment in an apparent two-phase process. The first elimination phase had an apparent half-life of approximately 7 min. Radioactivity quickly appeared in the urine with 10-16% eliminated during the first 2 h following intravenous infusion; 7%, 2-5 h; 4%, 5-8 h; 4%, 8-15 h; and 1.5%, 15-24 h from the [14C] LTE4 experiments. Unmetabolized LTE4 was the major radioactive component in the first urine collection, but at later times two more polar compounds predominated. After extensive purification by normal phase-solid phase extraction and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, these compounds were characterized by UV spectroscopy, co-elution with synthetic standards, negative ion electron capture gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry. The two major urinary metabolites were structurally determined to be 14-carboxy-hexanor-LTE3 and the conjugated tetraene, 16-carboxy-delta 13-tetranor-LTE4. Three other minor metabolites were detectable in the first urine collection only and were characterized by co-elution with synthetic standards as 16-carboxy-tetranor-LTE3, 18-carboxy-dinor-LTE4, and 20-carboxy-LTE4. omega-Oxidation and subsequent beta-oxidation from the methyl terminus appeared to be the major metabolic fate for sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in man. The accumulation of the 14-COOH-LTE3 and 16-COOH-delta 13-LTE4 may reflect a rate-limiting step in further oxidation of these compounds which places a conjugated triene or conjugated tetraene, respectively, two carbons removed from the CoA ester moiety. Also in the first urine collection there was another minor metabolite identified as N-acetyl-LTE4, however, no subsequent beta-oxidation of this metabolite was observed. The major metabolites of LTE4 might be useful in assessing in vivo production of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in humans.",

Three different radiolabeled tracers were employed, [14,15-3H]LTE4, [35S]LTE4, and [14C] LTE4 in five separate infusion studies. There was a rapid disappearance of radioactivity from the vascular compartment in an apparent two-phase process. The first elimination phase had an apparent half-life of approximately 7 min. Radioactivity quickly appeared in the urine with 10-16% eliminated during the first 2 h following intravenous infusion; 7%, 2-5 h; 4%, 5-8 h; 4%, 8-15 h; and 1.5%, 15-24 h from the [14C] LTE4 experiments. Unmetabolized LTE4 was the major radioactive component in the first urine collection, but at later times two more polar compounds predominated. After extensive purification by normal phase-solid phase extraction and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, these compounds were characterized by UV spectroscopy, co-elution with synthetic standards, negative ion electron capture gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry. The two major urinary metabolites were structurally determined to be 14-carboxy-hexanor-LTE3 and the conjugated tetraene, 16-carboxy-delta 13-tetranor-LTE4. Three other minor metabolites were detectable in the first urine collection only and were characterized by co-elution with synthetic standards as 16-carboxy-tetranor-LTE3, 18-carboxy-dinor-LTE4, and 20-carboxy-LTE4. omega-Oxidation and subsequent beta-oxidation from the methyl terminus appeared to be the major metabolic fate for sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in man. The accumulation of the 14-COOH-LTE3 and 16-COOH-delta 13-LTE4 may reflect a rate-limiting step in further oxidation of these compounds which places a conjugated triene or conjugated tetraene, respectively, two carbons removed from the CoA ester moiety. Also in the first urine collection there was another minor metabolite identified as N-acetyl-LTE4, however, no subsequent beta-oxidation of this metabolite was observed. The major metabolites of LTE4 might be useful in assessing in vivo production of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in humans.",

                                        "abstract": "Abstract Carbon Capture and Storage is developed as state-of-the-art method to bring CO 2 emissions under control. Among different options, saline aquifers are viable choices to sequestrate CO 2 in which this gas can be dissolved in the pertinent brine through a gradual progressive diffusive layer and subsequent possible density-induced convection. Quantification of CO 2 dissolution rate in saline aquifers is dependent on the true estimation of CO 2 diffusivity in brine. In this work, equilibrium dissolution and diffusion coefficient of CO 2 in water-saturated porous medium is modeled. The simple and well-known pressure-decay method is applied numerically in different porous systems. Also, interference of density-driven convection using different permeability values is addressed and the idea of using a porous medium such as glass bead model is proposed to block convective swirls or postpone onset of convection. Convective currents are suppressed at Rayleigh numbers (Ra) fewer than 40. For controlled convective dissolution, the onset of convection should be late enough for that early diffusive dissolution to dominate. Also, convective dissolution should deviate from diffusive dissolution to find the onset of convection and time at the end of early convection. The former and latter require Ra\u00a0 \u00a0150, respectively. Under these circumstances, pressure decay results can be analyzed to estimate the gas\u2013liquid diffusion coefficient using early pressure\u2013time data, onset of convection, the maximum Sherwood and time at the end of early convection.",
