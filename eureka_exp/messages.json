As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

Here's the revised reward function code that includes the correct output format, adheres to the given guidelines, and takes into account the attributes of the provided environment class definition:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(velocity: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    temperature = 1.0\n\n    velocity_reward = torch.exp(temperature * velocity.norm(dim=-1))  # Apply temperature and exponential transformation\n\n    reward_components = {\n        'velocity_reward': velocity_reward\n    }\n\n    total_reward = torch.sum(velocity_reward)  # Compute the total reward as the sum of individual rewards\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\nI apologize for the oversight in providing an incomplete code response earlier. This updated reward function calculates the velocity reward component using the temperature and exponential transformation on the norm of the velocity. The total reward is then computed as the sum of the velocity reward component. The output includes both the total reward and a dictionary of the individual reward components.\n\nYou can now use this updated reward function to train your RL policy and track the individual reward components and global policy metrics as described.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"
