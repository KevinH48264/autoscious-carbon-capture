11/6/23 Notes on TODOs:
1. Invalid request -- need to deal with too long prompt tokens
Well just move to a longer prompt sequence for now? Or use OpenAI’s new assistants
Need a closer look -- perhaps try with a more toy example to truly study what’s going on (I can make up a mystery that it needs to solve by constantly querying me)
Is the line of questioning in the right direction?
Are the prompts informative to the curriculum agent? Is the system positioned to make a breakthrough by following this process for truth?
