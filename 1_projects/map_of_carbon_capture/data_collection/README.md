## Retrieve more data
1. Edit and run retrieve_data.py (currently only retrieves new paper data and not direct citations for edges yet)
2. Go to autoscious-carbon-capture/knowledge_base folder, follow the README.md to update the knowledge base

### Improvements
1. When updating search_score, all changes to existing df can be made in a temporary dict and then applying all changes to Dataframe at once

## For testing with data retrievel
1. Edit and use data_collection.ipynb
