This opens up the potential for exceptional efficiency in CCU in natural gas flue emissions.\\n\\nThe use of genetic algorithms has facilitated tuning of the charge equilibration method to derive accurate framework partial charges. This has led to an understanding of the effect that pore topology has on carbon capture performance.\\n\\nA study analyzing all global CCS projects indicates that the rate of building these projects is 100 times too slow to meet emission reduction targets. Urgent action for all countries is required to commercially assess CO2 storage.\\n\\nThe development of enhanced gutter layers using two- and three-dimensional metal-organic framework materials has led to considerable improvements in both CO2 permeance and selectivity, improving on traditional poly(dimethylsiloxane) materials.\\n\\nFinally, utilizing low-cost, commercially ready CO2 capture opportunities for existing ethanol biorefineries in the United States reveals substantial near-term opportunities to improve the impacts of conventional biofuels, catalyze the growth of carbon capture infrastructure, and satisfy low-carbon fuel policies. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of CCU in mitigating climate change and the vast potential for MOFs to play a pivotal role in carbon capture.'}])"
