### 1_projects
- Projects. A new top-level folder for each major effort (rough criteria: a project represents 1-6 months of work). Engineers and researchers work here.
Code is reviewed for correctness. Testing is recommended but optional, as is continuous integration.
- No cross-project dependencies. If you need code from a different project, either go through the effort of polishing the code into core, or clone the code.
