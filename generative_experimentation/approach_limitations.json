    "approach": "Direct Air Capture (DAC) with Carbon Storage",
    "proposition": "DAC with carbon storage is an ideal approach as it directly captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in a secure manner. It has the potential to capture large amounts of CO2 and can be deployed in various locations, making it a scalable solution.",
    "opposition": "The biggest weakness of DAC with carbon storage is its high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured. The energy consumption is also significant, requiring a substantial amount of electricity. Additionally, the storage capacity of certain methods may be limited, requiring frequent transportation and storage infrastructure.",
