    "1": "Efficiency: The ideal approach should focus on improving the efficiency of the carbon capture process to reduce the cost per metric ton of CO2 captured. This can be achieved by optimizing the design and operation of the capture technology, minimizing energy requirements, and maximizing the utilization of captured CO2.",
    "2": "Economy of Scale: The ideal approach should consider the potential benefits of scaling up carbon capture projects. By increasing the scale of operations, economies of scale can be realized, leading to lower costs per metric ton of CO2 captured. This can be achieved by implementing large-scale carbon capture projects and creating favorable market conditions for carbon capture deployment.",
    "3": "Integration: The ideal approach should focus on integrating carbon capture technologies with existing industrial processes or energy systems. By capturing CO2 emissions directly from industrial sources or power plants, the cost per metric ton of CO2 captured can be reduced. This can be achieved through retrofitting existing facilities or designing new facilities with integrated carbon capture capabilities.",
    "4": "Policy Support: The ideal approach should involve supportive policies and regulations that incentivize the deployment of carbon capture technologies. This can include carbon pricing mechanisms, tax incentives, grants, and subsidies to reduce the financial burden and encourage investment in carbon capture projects.",
    "5": "Innovation: The ideal approach should encourage innovation in carbon capture technologies to develop more cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions. This can be achieved through research and development investments, collaboration between academia and industry, and incentivizing the development of breakthrough technologies."
