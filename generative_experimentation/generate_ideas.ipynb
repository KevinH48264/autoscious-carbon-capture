Additionally, exploring innovative methods for spreading minerals effectively and efficiently can help overcome the challenges associated with land or ocean area requirements.\\'}, \\'3\\': {\\'approach\\': \\'Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)\\', \\'proposition\\': \\'BECCS involves generating energy from biomass while capturing and storing the CO2 emissions. It has the potential to achieve negative emissions by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. BECCS can utilize existing biomass resources and infrastructure, making it a feasible approach.\\', \\'opposition\\': \\'The biggest weakness of BECCS is the competition for land and resources between biomass production for energy and other essential purposes like food production. The storage capacity of CO2 may also be limited, requiring long-term monitoring and potential leakage prevention. Additionally, the energy consumption and cost per metric ton of CO2 captured need to be optimized.\\', \\'opportunities\\': \\'To improve this approach, research can focus on developing sustainable biomass feedstocks that do not compete with food production. Enhancing the efficiency of biomass conversion and CO2 capture technologies can help reduce energy consumption and cost. Exploring alternative storage methods with higher capacity and long-term stability can also enhance the effectiveness of BECCS.\\'}}\\n\\nTask:\\nSuppose each metric was rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being a perfect solution and 1 being unable to deploy because the solution is terrible based on this metric.
