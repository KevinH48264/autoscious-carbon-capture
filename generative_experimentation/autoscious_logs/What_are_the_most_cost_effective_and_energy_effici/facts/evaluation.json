    "best_answer": "The most cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies currently available include direct air capture (DAC) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies [On Monday, carbon capture firm Climeworks added another plant to this list, opening its third direct air capture (DAC) plant in Troia, Italy.[https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/]]. These technologies have the potential to capture large amounts of CO2 and can be deployed in various locations, making them scalable solutions. Additionally, amine-based absorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation are considered to be cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies [Amine-based absorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation are among the most cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies currently available.[https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/]].",
    "opposition": "The biggest weakness of DAC and CCS technologies is their high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured [The Carbon Capture & Storage Association (CCSA) estimated that the earlier CCS projects in the power sector would cost between \u20ac60\u2013\u20ac90 per tonne of carbon dioxide abated, the equivalent of around $69-$103 per tonne.\nThe association also predicted that these costs will decline to \u20ac35\u2013\u20ac50 ($40-$57) in the early 2020s, thanks to technological advancements.[https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/]]. The energy consumption of these technologies is also significant, requiring a substantial amount of electricity [Amine-based absorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation are among the most cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies currently available.[https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/]].",
    "proposition": "The most cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies currently available are direct air capture (DAC) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.

Additionally, amine-based absorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic separation are considered to be cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon capture technologies.",
    "conclusion": "No, the best answer is not a first-rate answer to the key question because the cost per metric ton of CO2 captured is high and the energy consumption is significant.",
    "next_question": "What are the ongoing research and development efforts to improve the cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency of carbon capture technologies?"
