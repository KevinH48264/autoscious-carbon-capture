    "The cost of carbon capture varies depending on the source of the carbon captured, the distance to the storage site, and the nature of the storage site itself. However, the Carbon Capture & Storage Association (CCSA) estimated that earlier CCS projects in the power sector would cost between €60–€90 per tonne of carbon dioxide abated, equivalent to around $69-$103 per tonne. The association also predicted that these costs will decline to €35–€50 ($40-$57) in the early 2020s, thanks to technological advancements.": "The Carbon Capture & Storage Association (CCSA) estimated that the earlier CCS projects in the power sector would cost between €60–€90 per tonne of carbon dioxide abated, the equivalent of around $69-$103 per tonne.\nThe association also predicted that these costs will decline to €35–€50 ($40-$57) in the early 2020s, thanks to technological advancements.[https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-capture-cost/]",
