    "body": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is any of several technologies that trap carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted from large industrial plants before this greenhouse gas can enter the atmosphere. CCS projects typically target 90 percent efficiency, meaning that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from the power plant will be captured and stored."
