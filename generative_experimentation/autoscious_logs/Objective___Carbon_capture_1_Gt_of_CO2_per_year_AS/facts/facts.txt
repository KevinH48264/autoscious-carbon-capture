The biggest weakness of DAC with carbon storage is its high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured. The energy consumption is also significant, requiring a substantial amount of electricity. Additionally, the storage capacity of certain methods may be limited, requiring frequent transportation and storage infrastructure.
The existing approach for carbon capture is Direct Air Capture (DAC) with Carbon Storage, which directly captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in a secure manner. However, it has limitations such as high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured, significant energy consumption, and limited storage capacity.
The dominant capture technology for carbon capture is absorption, or carbon scrubbing with amines.
The existing approach of Direct Air Capture (DAC) with Carbon Storage is an ideal approach for capturing large amounts of CO2 and can be deployed in various locations, making it a scalable solution. However, it has limitations such as high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured, significant energy consumption, and limited storage capacity.
The existing approach of Direct Air Capture (DAC) with Carbon Storage is considered an ideal approach for capturing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it securely. However, it has limitations such as high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured, significant energy consumption, and limited storage capacity.

However, it has limitations such as high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured, significant energy consumption, and limited storage capacity.
The cost of using DAC to sequester carbon dioxide is several times the carbon price.
The best approach to achieve the objective of capturing 1 Gt of CO2 per year ASAP is Direct Air Capture (DAC) with Carbon Storage.
The ideal approach should focus on improving the efficiency of the carbon capture process to reduce the cost per metric ton of CO2 captured. This can be achieved by optimizing the design and operation of the capture technology, minimizing energy requirements, and maximizing the utilization of captured CO2.
