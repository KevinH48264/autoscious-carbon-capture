    "body": "Howard Herzog, a Senior Research Engineer in the MIT Energy Initiative, says that CCS projects have used 90 percent efficiency as a baseline target 1 for decades because a system needs to remove at least that much CO 2 to be worth the investment to build and install it, and also because 90 percent is an achievable goal."

Just considering the role for CCS implicit in the IPCC 1.5 SAR, somewhere between 350 and 1,200 gigatonnes of CO2 will need to be captured and stored this century. Currently, some 40 megatonnes of CO2 are captured and stored annually. This must increase at least 100-fold by 2050 to meet the ..."

Levels of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere have been increasing steadily since the Industrial Revolution, and are now higher than at any time in the geological record."
