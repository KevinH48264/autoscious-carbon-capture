One ongoing research and development effort to improve the cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency of carbon capture technologies is the development of a water-lean solvent that can absorb carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere. This technology has been tested in the lab and at a pilot plant scale, and has been scaled up to a 12-megawatt demonstration facility in Norway. The solvent allows carbon to be captured at a cost of approximately $42 per ton, close to the Department of Energy's target of between $30 and $40 per ton [We have developed a water-lean solvent that can absorb carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere. We tested this technology in our lab and at the pilot plant scale at SINTEF and have scaled up 200,000X to a 12-megawatt demonstration facility in Norway. Our solvent allows carbon to be captured at a cost of approximately $42 per ton, close to the Department of Energy\u2019s target of between $30 and $40 per ton.[https://www.rti.org/impact/carbon-capture-technology]].",
    "opposition": "There is a need for stronger financial incentives, such as a carbon price, to encourage power plants to invest in higher capture percentages [To realize that goal, however, power plants will have to pay a lot more for every extra molecule of CO2 they capture\u2014which means they need stronger financial incentives to cut their carbon emissions. A carbon price would be one way to create those incentives, by taxing plants on whatever CO2 enters the atmosphere.[https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-efficient-carbon-capture-and-storage]].",
    "proposition": "Ongoing research and development efforts, such as the development of water-lean solvents, are aimed at improving the cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency of carbon capture technologies. These efforts have shown promising results, with the development of a solvent that can capture carbon at a cost close to the target set by the Department of Energy [The ongoing research and development efforts are focused on improving the cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency of carbon capture technologies.[https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-efficient-carbon-capture-and-storage]][We have developed a water-lean solvent that can absorb carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere.

    "conclusion": "Yes, the best answer is a first-rate answer to the key question. Ongoing research and development efforts are actively working towards improving the cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency of carbon capture technologies, which aligns with the objective of capturing 1 Gt of CO2 per year ASAP.",
    "next_question": "What are the financial incentives and policy measures that can encourage power plants to invest in higher capture percentages?"
