(16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g). The “half-site reactivity” is also consistent with a negative, rather than positive, cooperativity, as almost all our kinetics data indicate.To understand if the conventional half-site reactivity theory can be applied to the ECR tetramer case, we created a model for the enzyme kinetics assuming positive or negative cooperativity between the pairs of dimers.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary catalytic activity of ECRs on the level of the protein assembly remain elusive. Here we used a combination of ambient-temperature X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) and cryogenic synchrotron experiments to study the structural organization of the ECR from Kitasatospora setae. The K. setae ECR is a homotetramer that differentiates into a pair of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits in the catalytical', 'ificantly to provide two sets of active site conformations─open and closed forms─upon binding of the NADPH cofactors in the presence of substrates. This coordinated motion is enabled by a tight coupling of catalytic domains across the pairs of dimers, which we could trace to the role of individual amino acids far away from the active site. Using computer simulations and kinetic experiments, we provide compelling evidence that synchronization across the pair of dimers through “swing and twist motions” is crucial for the K. setae ECR to achieve high catalytic rates. We further demonstrate that subunit communication within a dimer is essential to synchronize open and closed states. Altogether, our results unveil a dynamic intersubunit synchronization of the K. setae ECR complex that is essential for the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes during catalysis.Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclus', 'ly active state. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based mutagenesis, we show that catalysis is synchronized in the K. setae ECR across the pair of dimers. This conformational coupling of catalytic domains is conferred by individual amino acids to achieve high CO2-fixation rates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into the dynamic organization and synchronized inter- and intrasubunit communications of this remarkably efficient CO2-fixing enzyme during catalysis.SynopsisIntersubunit coupling drives fast carboxylation by enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases, providing the basis for engineering highly efficient CO2-fixing enzymes for bioenergy and bioproduct applications.IntroductionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferencesThe capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2 remains a challenging task for chemistry, resulting in an ever', 'ast CO2 FixationOur structural studies of the K. setae ECR revealed unprecedented details on the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient and fastest CO2-fixing enzymes. During catalysis, the enzyme complex differentiates into distinct functional subunits. The binding of the NADPH cofactor and substrates forces the homotetrameric apo enzyme into a pair of dimers. Each dimer is constituted of open- and closed-form subunits. In the closed-form subunits, the NADPH cofactor and CoA substrate are aligned with each other, suggesting that this is the catalytically competent state. The open-form subunits bind the cofactor and the substrate adenine rings, but the rest of the acyl-CoA substrate remains flexible and invisible in the active site. Thus, the open-subunit active sites represent a catalytically incompetent state that is preorganized for a subsequent round of catalysis. Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzym', 'sm, despite having very high structural similarities. Overall, this work indicated that ECRs from primary metabolism must use specific mechanisms that allow them to enhance CO2 fixation dramatically in comparison to their structurally closely related homologues from secondary metabolism.Here, we aimed at providing a mechanistic understanding of the fast carboxylation reaction of the K. setae ECR on the level of the overall oligomeric complex. We first determined four high-resolution K. setae ECR structures in different conformational states: the apo form and three holo forms in a binary complex with the reduced cofactor NADPH, in a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, and a binary complex with the oxidized cofactor NADP+ (Figure 1b).Our high-resolution structures show that the tetrameric complex assumes a pair of dimers geometry. In this complex, the central oligomerization domains of the K. setae ECR remain essentially unchanged, while the peripheral catalytic domains move sign', 'ionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferences Apo ECR Is a Symmetric Homotetramer, Readily Accessible for Cofactor and Substrate BindingWe first determined the apo form of the ECR crystal structure from K. setae at 1.8 Å resolution using synchrotron X-ray crystallography at cryogenic temperature (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The asymmetric unit contains one homotetramer composed of four subunits arranged in a pair of dimers geometry similar to those of previously reported binary and ternary ECR complexes, crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase AntE in complex with NADP+ (PDB: 4Y0K) and 2-octenoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase CinF in complex with NADP+ and 2-octenoyl-CoA, (PDB: 4A0S), respectively. Overall, the K. setae ECR tetramer shows a noncrystallographic, close to D2 (dihedral) symmetry with four conformationally identical subunits (Figures S1 and S2). The tetrameric oligomer state of the ECR apo enzyme is furthe', 'trates/products and NADPH/NADP+ (p22), while only 10% are half-occupied (p12 + p21) (Figure S12). Almost none of the dimers are empty (p11), which agrees with the occupancy of our experimentally determined structures of the ternary complex.To synchronize half-site reactivity, the interaction of the catalytic domains across and within the pairs of dimers is crucial. When the latter is perturbed in the K. setae ECR (e.g., through triple mutant E151D/N157E/N218E or by disturbance of the adenosine binding pocket), the catalytic rate of the enzyme is severely diminished. This observation is consistent with other theoretical and experimental data on half-site reactivity. The synchronization of distant catalytic subunits has been calculated to enhance the catalytic rate of enzymes by up to 20-fold. (21,22) Mutation of a single amino acid that couples the two catalytic sites of heptose isomerase GmhA reduced the catalytic rate to 6% of wild-type activity.

The optimization of CO2-fixing organisms not only has to cope with the structural complexity of the multiprotein complexes responsible for photosynthesis and carbon capturing systems but also with their highly sophisticated regulation and the involvement of protection systems. (4) Despite tremendous research effort, it has not been possible to improve the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco itself.Kitasatospora setae ECR generates a reactive enolate species by the reduction of an enoyl-CoA substrate with NADPH, which then conducts a nucleophilic attack on a bound CO2 molecule, challenging the notion that the enolate intermediate must be protected against protonation by the solvent.The limita', 'tions of natural CO2-fixation systems and their resilience against optimization has spurred interest in CO2 enzymes from different metabolic pathways. Some of them are distinguished by much higher reaction rates than Rubisco and could find applications in artificial metabolic pathways. (2,5) In this context, Wakatsuki and co-workers have achieved remarkable insight into the complex mechanism of an enoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (ECR) from Streptomycetes (Figure 1).

Moreover, the combination of the TaCo pathway with the 17 enzymes of the synthetic CO2 fixation cycle crotonyl–coenzyme A (CoA)/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) previously described in vitro as much faster than the Calvin-Benson cycle (Schwander et al., 2018), was proposed as a strategy with higher carbon and energy efficiency (Bernhardsgrütter et al., 2021; Scheffen et al., 2021). Another recent possibility of photorespiration bypass to be introduced in C3 plants is the β-hydroxyaspartate cycle (BHAC), a microbial glycolate assimilation pathway (Roell et al., 2021).Show abstractPhotosynthesis is responsible for the primary productivity and maintenance of life on Earth, boosting biological activity and contributing to the maintenance of the environment', ' CatalysisView all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleEditorial overview: Energy biotechnologyCurrent Opinion in Biotechnology, Volume 67, 2021, pp. iii-vResearch articleEnzymatic conversion of CO2 to CH3OH via reverse dehydrogenase cascade biocatalysis: Quantitative comparison of efficiencies of immobilized enzyme systemsBiochemical Engineering Journal, Volume 127, 2017, pp. 217-228Show abstractA designed biocatalytic cascade system based on reverse enzymatic catalysis by formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.46), and alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol (CH3OH) via formation of formic acid (CHOOH) and formaldehyde (CHOH) during equimolar cofactor oxidation of NADH to NAD+.

Introduction\\n \\n \\nCarbon fixation is the process by which enzymes known as carboxylases \\nutilize\\n \\ninorganic \\ncarbon, in the form of gaseous C\\nO\\n2\\n, and incorporate it into \\nbiomass. The enzyme Ribulose 1,5\\n‐\\nbisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) found in plants and bacteria is responsible for \\nfixing 400 Gt of carbon per year\\n1\\n. \\nNature’s\\n \\nCO\\n2\\n‐\\nfixing catalysts are of great interest because \\nthey possess the ability of utilizing atmospheric CO\\n2\\n \\nunder mild conditions.
