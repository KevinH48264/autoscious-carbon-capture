It is composed of a pair of dimers that take open and closed configurations, undergoing significant conformational rearrangement to achieve a catalytically active state. (1) Insight into the mode of action of ECRs, as well as the chemistry involved, has been limited by a dearth of high-resolution structures of ECRs in complex with catalytic intermediates and carboxylated products. The authors present four high-resolution structures of the K. setae ECR, one in the unliganded apo form, and three liganded forms of the enzyme: two binary complexes with reduced NADPH and oxidized NADP+, respectively, as well as a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA.Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers.While the elucidation of the structures is itself impressive, the authors then use these structures as a basis for detailed molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to reveal substantial conformational transitions that occur during the catalytic cycle. In brief, (1) the unliganded apo form of the enzyme is a symmetric homotetramer, composed of a dimer of dimers, with each subunit being comprised of two domains: a larger catalytic domain and a smaller oligomerization domain. The catalytic domains are at the periphery of the tetramer, and the associated active sites are open and accessible for cofactors and substrates in the apoenzyme.

      "Source text: a pair of asymmetric dimers. In all four subunits, NADPH spans both the catalytic and oligomerization domains, with its adenine moiety bound to the oligomerization domain and its nicotinamide moiety bound to the catalytic domain. (3) The cofactor–substrate complex indicates an additional layer of complexity: while NADPH appears to be bound to all four subunits, only two closed-form subunits show density for the complete thioester, whereas the two open-form subunits represent catalytically incompetent ternary complexes. QM/MM simulations indicate that the substrate is conformationally constrained in the closed-form subunits, and highly dynamic in the open-form subunits, suggesting half-site reactivity. (4) Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers. Removing the substrate from the closed-form subunits resulted in rapid conformational changes in just a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time, causing the closed-form subunits to transition to an open-form conformation, coupled with a twist motion of one subunit to the other in each dimer. In the A/C dimer, which opens its closed subunit first, this twisting motion was shown to rotate the catalytic domain of the now-empty open-form active site in subunit A, which would then be expected to push a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor in the C-subunit. Further simulations indicated coupling between the dynamics of each dimer pair in the tetrameric complex (Figure 2), that is regulated by the absence or release of substrate.Figure 2Figure 2.

      "Source text: a pair of asymmetric dimers. In all four subunits, NADPH spans both the catalytic and oligomerization domains, with its adenine moiety bound to the oligomerization domain and its nicotinamide moiety bound to the catalytic domain. (3) The cofactor–substrate complex indicates an additional layer of complexity: while NADPH appears to be bound to all four subunits, only two closed-form subunits show density for the complete thioester, whereas the two open-form subunits represent catalytically incompetent ternary complexes. QM/MM simulations indicate that the substrate is conformationally constrained in the closed-form subunits, and highly dynamic in the open-form subunits, suggesting half-site reactivity. (4) Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers. Removing the substrate from the closed-form subunits resulted in rapid conformational changes in just a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time, causing the closed-form subunits to transition to an open-form conformation, coupled with a twist motion of one subunit to the other in each dimer. In the A/C dimer, which opens its closed subunit first, this twisting motion was shown to rotate the catalytic domain of the now-empty open-form active site in subunit A, which would then be expected to push a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor in the C-subunit. Further simulations indicated coupling between the dynamics of each dimer pair in the tetrameric complex (Figure 2), that is regulated by the absence or release of substrate.Figure 2Figure 2.

      "It has long been speculated that the SSUL modules interact with Rubisco by replacing RbcS2-4.\n",
      "Here we have reconstituted the Rubisco-CcmM complex and solved its structure.\n",
      "Contrary to expectation, the SSUL modules do not replace RbcS, but bind close to the equatorial region of Rubisco between RbcL dimers, linking Rubisco mols. and inducing phase sepn. into a liq.-like matrix.\n",
      "Disulfide bond formation in SSUL increases the network flexibility and is required for carboxysome function in vivo.\n",
      "Notably, the formation of the liq.-like condensate of Rubisco is mediated by dynamic interactions with the SSUL domains, rather than by low-complexity sequences, which typically mediate liq.-liq. phase sepn. in eukaryotes12,13.\n",

      "Source text: ynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, and dynamical networks to describe the allosteric activation of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) from the substrate-free form to the active ternary complex.\n",
      "IGPS is a heterodimeric bienzyme complex whose HisH subunit is responsible for hydrolyzing glutamine and delivering ammonia for the cyclase activity in HisF.\n",
      "Despite significant advances in understanding the underlying allosteric mechanism, essential mol. details of the long-range millisecond allosteric activation of IGPS remain hidden.\n",
      "Without using a priori information of the active state, our simulations uncover how IGPS, with the allosteric effector bound in HisF, spontaneously captures glutamine in a catalytically inactive HisH conformation, subsequently attains a closed HisF:HisH interface, and finally forms the oxyanion hole in HisH for efficient glutamine hydrolysis.\n",
      "We show that the combined effector and substrate binding dramatically decreases the conformational barrier assocd. with oxyanion hole formation, in line with the exptl. obsd. 4500-fold activity increase in glutamine hydrolysis.\n",
      "The allosteric activation is controlled by correlated time-evolving dynamic networks connecting the effector and substrate binding sites.\n",
      "This computational strategy tailored to describe millisecond events can be used to rationalize the effect of mutations on the allosteric regulation and guide IGPS engineering efforts. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38XpsVars74%253D&md5=9cf378e4a110e6bdf97b00b8b0c39449\n",

      "Source text: ContentsSignificanceAbstractData AvailabilityAcknowledgmentsSupporting InformationReferencesInformation & AuthorsMetrics & CitationsView OptionsReferencesMediaShareSignificanceCarboxylases capture and convert CO2, which makes them key enzymes in photosynthesis and the global carbon cycle. However, the question how enzymes bind atmospheric CO2 is still unsolved. We studied enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs), the fastest CO2-fixing enzymes in nature, using structural biology, biochemistry, and advanced computational methods. Ecrs create a highly specific CO2-binding pocket with 4 amino acids at the active site. The pocket controls the fate of the gaseous molecule during catalysis and shields the catalytic center from oxygen and water. This exquisite control makes Ecrs highly efficient carboxylases outcompeting RuBisCO, the key enzyme of photosynthesis, by an order of magnitude. Our findings define the atomic framework for the future development of CO2-converting catalysts in biology and chemistry.AbstractCarboxylases are biocatalysts that capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) under mild conditions and atmospheric concentrations at a scale of more than 400 Gt annually. However, how these enzymes bind and control the gaseous CO2 molecule during catalysis is only poorly understood. One of the most efficient classes of carboxylating enzymes are enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs), which outcompete the plant enzyme RuBisCO in catalytic efficiency and fidelity by more than an order of magnitude. Here we investigated the interactions of CO2 within the active site of Ecr from Kitasatospora setae. Combining experimental biochemistry, protein crystallography, and advanced computer simulations we show that 4 amino acids, N81, F170, E171, and H365, are required to create a highly efficient CO2-fixing enzyme. Together, these 4 residues anchor and position the CO2 molecule for the attack by a reactive enolate created during the catalytic cycle. Notably, a highly ordered water molecule plays an important role in an active site that is otherwise carefully shielded from water, which is detrimental to CO2 fixation. Altogether, our study reveals unprecedented molecular details of selective CO2 binding and C–C-bond formation during the catalytic cycle of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzyme. This knowledge provides the basis for the future development of catalytic frameworks for the capture and conversion of CO2 in biology and chemistry.Continue ReadingVIEW PDFFULL TEXTData AvailabilityData deposition: Crystallography, atomic coordinates, and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), http://www.rcsb.org/; PDB ID code: 6OWE.AcknowledgmentsD.A.S. and E.V.-M. acknowledge K.

      "Source text: le and invisible in the active site. Thus, the open-subunit active sites represent a catalytically incompetent state that is preorganized for a subsequent round of catalysis. Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzyme operates with “half-site reactivity”. (16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g). The “half-site reactivity” is also consistent with a negative, rather than positive, cooperativity, as almost all our kinetics data indicate.To understand if the conventional half-site reactivity theory can be applied to the ECR tetramer case, we created a model for the enzyme kinetics assuming positive or negative cooperativity between the pairs of dimers. Instead of treating the four subunits as independent entities, we hypothesized that the two pairs of ECR dimers would cycle through the CO2-fixing reactions in synchrony: i.e., when one dimer switches from the open–close to the closed–open states, the other dimer would do the opposite, closed–open to open–closed states. Using this model, we simulated the case with just one dimer with two subunits working in negative or positive cooperativity using the method described by Hill and Levitski (21) (Figure S12). For a thorough investigation of how cooperativity, positive or negative, enhances the overall reaction rate of the K. setae ECR, we incorporated all the parameters in Hill and Levitski’s model in our simulation. It turned out that only negative cooperativity could explain our experimental observations that ECR activity in the WT tetramer is increased by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the triple variant E151D/N157E/N218E, in which synchronization is decoupled (Table 1). Our simulations yielded a 90% probability that both active sites are occupied with substrates/products and NADPH/NADP+ (p22), while only 10% are half-occupied (p12 + p21) (Figure S12). Almost none of the dimers are empty (p11), which agrees with the occupancy of our experimentally determined structures of the ternary complex.To synchronize half-site reactivity, the interaction of the catalytic domains across and within the pairs of dimers is crucial. When the latter is perturbed in the K. setae ECR (e.g., through triple mutant E151D/N157E/N218E or by disturbance of the adenosine binding pocket), the catalytic rate of the enzyme is severely diminished. This observation is consistent with other theoretical and experimental data on half-site reactivity. The synchronization of distant catalytic subunits has been calculated to enhance the catalytic rate of enzymes by up to 20-fold. (21,22) Mutation of a single amino acid that couples the two catalytic sites of heptose isomerase GmhA reduced the catalytic rate to 6% of wild-type activity. (23) Perturbing the interaction network in Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase, another example of an enzyme with half-site reactivity, (24) caused a 400-fold decrease in kcat, (25,26) demonstrating that domain interactions are essential in promoting enzyme catalysis. (27)While our structural, biochemical, and simulation data indicate that the K. setae ECR achieves high catalytic rates by synchronizing active sites, this might not necessarily be true for other ECRs. A differentiation into a pair of dimers was not observed in NADPH-bound or ternary structures of other ECRs (e.g., PDB 4Y0K and 4A0S, respectively, which share substantial amino acid identity) (Figure S13). Note, however, that ECRs fall into two different classes: primary ECRs (such as the\n",

Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzyme operates with “half-site reactivity”. (16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g).

      "Source text: fixation rates in comparison to those ECR complexes from secondary metabolism, despite having very high structural similarities. Overall, this work indicated that ECRs from primary metabolism must use specific mechanisms that allow them to enhance CO2 fixation dramatically in comparison to their structurally closely related homologues from secondary metabolism.Here, we aimed at providing a mechanistic understanding of the fast carboxylation reaction of the K. setae ECR on the level of the overall oligomeric complex. We first determined four high-resolution K. setae ECR structures in different conformational states: the apo form and three holo forms in a binary complex with the reduced cofactor NADPH, in a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, and a binary complex with the oxidized cofactor NADP+ (Figure 1b).Our high-resolution structures show that the tetrameric complex assumes a pair of dimers geometry. In this complex, the central oligomerization domains of the K. setae ECR remain essentially unchanged, while the peripheral catalytic domains move significantly to provide two sets of active site conformations─open and closed forms─upon binding of the NADPH cofactors in the presence of substrates. This coordinated motion is enabled by a tight coupling of catalytic domains across the pairs of dimers, which we could trace to the role of individual amino acids far away from the active site. Using computer simulations and kinetic experiments, we provide compelling evidence that synchronization across the pair of dimers through “swing and twist motions” is crucial for the K. setae ECR to achieve high catalytic rates. We further demonstrate that subunit communication within a dimer is essential to synchronize open and closed states. Altogether, our results unveil a dynamic intersubunit synchronization of the K. setae ECR complex that is essential for the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes during catalysis.Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferences Apo ECR Is a Symmetric Homotetramer, Readily Accessible for Cofactor and Substrate BindingWe first determined the apo form of the ECR crystal structure from K. setae at 1.8 Å resolution using synchrotron X-ray crystallography at cryogenic temperature (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The asymmetric unit contains one homotetramer composed of four subunits arranged in a pair of dimers geometry similar to those of previously reported binary and ternary ECR complexes, crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase AntE in complex with NADP+ (PDB: 4Y0K) and 2-octenoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase CinF in complex with NADP+ and 2-octenoyl-CoA, (PDB: 4A0S), respectively. Overall, the K. setae ECR tetramer shows a noncrystallographic, close to D2 (dihedral) symmetry with four conformationally identical subunits (Figures S1 and S2). The tetrameric oligomer state of the ECR apo enzyme is further supported by size-exclusion chromatography, which showed that the 51.2 kDa protein eluted as a single peak at 205 kDa (Figure S3).Each ECR subunit consists of two domains─a larger catalytic domain formed by residues 1–212 and 364–445, and a smaller oligomerization domain formed by residues 212–363 (Figure S4A). The oligomerization domain comprises a Rossmann fold (11) with repeating αβ-motifs that form a 6-stranded β-sheet (β12−β17). The 6-stranded β-sheets of two neighboring subunits are combined into one 12-stranded β-sheet, forming the core of one dimer, subunits A/C and B/D. Two of these Rossmann fold domains form the tetrameric complex’s core (Figure S4B). The catalytic domains of the K. setae ECR are located at the periphery of the tetrameric complex. The active site cavities in the apo form are open and accessible for both cofactors and substrates. We also determined the structure of NADP+-bound ECR at \n",

      "Source text: fixation rates in comparison to those ECR complexes from secondary metabolism, despite having very high structural similarities. Overall, this work indicated that ECRs from primary metabolism must use specific mechanisms that allow them to enhance CO2 fixation dramatically in comparison to their structurally closely related homologues from secondary metabolism.Here, we aimed at providing a mechanistic understanding of the fast carboxylation reaction of the K. setae ECR on the level of the overall oligomeric complex. We first determined four high-resolution K. setae ECR structures in different conformational states: the apo form and three holo forms in a binary complex with the reduced cofactor NADPH, in a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, and a binary complex with the oxidized cofactor NADP+ (Figure 1b).Our high-resolution structures show that the tetrameric complex assumes a pair of dimers geometry. In this complex, the central oligomerization domains of the K. setae ECR remain essentially unchanged, while the peripheral catalytic domains move significantly to provide two sets of active site conformations─open and closed forms─upon binding of the NADPH cofactors in the presence of substrates. This coordinated motion is enabled by a tight coupling of catalytic domains across the pairs of dimers, which we could trace to the role of individual amino acids far away from the active site. Using computer simulations and kinetic experiments, we provide compelling evidence that synchronization across the pair of dimers through “swing and twist motions” is crucial for the K. setae ECR to achieve high catalytic rates. We further demonstrate that subunit communication within a dimer is essential to synchronize open and closed states. Altogether, our results unveil a dynamic intersubunit synchronization of the K. setae ECR complex that is essential for the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes during catalysis.Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferences Apo ECR Is a Symmetric Homotetramer, Readily Accessible for Cofactor and Substrate BindingWe first determined the apo form of the ECR crystal structure from K. setae at 1.8 Å resolution using synchrotron X-ray crystallography at cryogenic temperature (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The asymmetric unit contains one homotetramer composed of four subunits arranged in a pair of dimers geometry similar to those of previously reported binary and ternary ECR complexes, crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase AntE in complex with NADP+ (PDB: 4Y0K) and 2-octenoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase CinF in complex with NADP+ and 2-octenoyl-CoA, (PDB: 4A0S), respectively. Overall, the K. setae ECR tetramer shows a noncrystallographic, close to D2 (dihedral) symmetry with four conformationally identical subunits (Figures S1 and S2). The tetrameric oligomer state of the ECR apo enzyme is further supported by size-exclusion chromatography, which showed that the 51.2 kDa protein eluted as a single peak at 205 kDa (Figure S3).Each ECR subunit consists of two domains─a larger catalytic domain formed by residues 1–212 and 364–445, and a smaller oligomerization domain formed by residues 212–363 (Figure S4A). The oligomerization domain comprises a Rossmann fold (11) with repeating αβ-motifs that form a 6-stranded β-sheet (β12−β17). The 6-stranded β-sheets of two neighboring subunits are combined into one 12-stranded β-sheet, forming the core of one dimer, subunits A/C and B/D. Two of these Rossmann fold domains form the tetrameric complex’s core (Figure S4B). The catalytic domains of the K. setae ECR are located at the periphery of the tetrameric complex. The active site cavities in the apo form are open and accessible for both cofactors and substrates. We also determined the structure of NADP+-bound ECR at \n",

One intriguing aspect of the ECR tetramer structures is that the catalytic domains share a common interface of 1636 Å2 between the pairs of dimers (Figure 5a,b), suggesting that they move together as rigid bodies.Figure 5Figure 5. Inter- and intradimer communications drive fast CO2 fixation by K. setae ECR.

The right panel shows the mutual H-bonding interaction between N218 and N157 from open- and closed-form subunits and H-bonding between E151 and the N atom from the protein backbone. (c) Alignment of ECR protein sequences from the primary (upper row) and the secondary (lower row) metabolisms represented as sequence logos. The numbering of residues, above the first row, is according to their position in the K. setae ECR. (d) Communication between the closed (green) and open (orange) subunits across the two dimers of the K. setae ECR. In the closed conformation the contacts between NADPH-H365-E165 and K332 of the adjacent open subunit allow for the correct intradimer communication. In the open conformation the communication network is compromised, as indicated by the increased distances between the amino acid side chains that cause the incorrect positioning of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWhat are the molecular determinants that synchronize catalysis across the pair of open/closed form dimers? The intercatalytic domain interface is predominantly hydrophobic with some electrostatic interactions (Figure 5b). Most notable are N218, which forms a hydrogen bond to N157 of the adjacent subunit of the other dimer, and E151 interacting with the backbone nitrogen atom of N133 (and/or A134) of the neighboring subunit of the other dimer (Figure 5b). A multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W (20) showed that E151, N218, and N157 are highly conserved in ECRs from primary (i.e., central carbon) metabolism with faster CO2-fixation kinetics (average kcat 28 s–1), but not in ECRs from secondary metabolism with an average kcat of 1.2 s–1 (Figure 5c), which raised the question about their potential role in promoting catalysis in primary metabolic ECRs.Notably, mutation of these residues that are more than 20 Å away from the active site dramatically affected the kinetic parameters of K. setae ECR (Table 1). In the E151D variant, the kcat value decreased by a factor of 5, demonstrating that weakening the interaction between catalytic domains has profound effects on the enzyme’s catalytic rate. Mutations that targeted the asparagine interaction network also showed substantial effects on the catalytic rate and affected the KM value of substrate binding. Most notable were a N218E single variant and E151D/N157E/N218E triple variants that decreased the kcat values by more than 25- and 100-fold, respectively, highlighting that communication through the interface of the catalytic domains of the pair of dimers is an essential determinant of the catalytic rate in K. setae ECR.Table 1.

      "Source text: re of NADP+-bound ECR at cryogenic temperature and found that it is rather similar to that of the apo form structure, although NADP+ molecules are bound in all four subunits. We postulate that the same crystallization conditions used for both structures might have resulted in the same space group (P212121) with similar crystal contacts, which might have kept the NADP+ bound ECR tetramer in the apo form. The NADP+-bound subunits are less rigid in comparison, and some residues show greater variations (Figures S1 and S2). Cofactor Binding Breaks Tetramer Symmetry and Induces Formation of a Pair of DimersIn order to understand the effects of binding of NADPH, a cofactor before reaction as opposed to the spent cofactor NADP+ described above, we then determined the K. setae ECR-NADPH binary complex’s crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) at ambient temperature (Figure 2 and Table S1). (12−15) In all four subunits, NADPH binds with its adenine moiety in the oligomerization domain and spans the catalytic domain, where its nicotinamide moiety is located (Figure S5).Figure 2Figure 2. Binding of NADPH results in global and local conformational changes in K. setae ECR. (a) NADPH-bound tetramer complex that is organized as pair of dimers, a pair of closed (green) and open (orange) subunits, and another pair containing closed (gray) and open (blue) subunits. (b) The foreground dimer with open (orange)- and closed-form (green) subunits rotated by 30° from the view in (a). Each subunit is composed of a catalytic and an oligomerization domain. (c) Comparison of the putative substrate binding sites between the open- and closed-form subunits.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideNotably, NADPH binding breaks the dihedral D2 symmetry observed in the apo-form tetramer, while symmetry about the y axis is retained, resulting in a noncrystallographic, almost cyclic C2 symmetry (Figure S1). In the NADPH*ECR binary complex, each of the two dimers, A/C and B/D, loses its 2-fold symmetry, giving rise to closed (A and B) and open (C and D) subunits (Figure 2a,b and Figure S1). In the A and B subunits, the cofactor binding pocket is compressed inward, which seals the NADPH cofactor within the catalytic domain, resulting in a “closed-form” state (Figure 2b). On the other hand, the C and D subunits show open cofactor-binding pockets, referred to hereafter as an “open-form” state. The substrate-binding pocket in the open-form C or D subunit is more than 5 Å wider than the closed A or B subunit (Figure 2c). When they were taken together, these structures indicated that during catalysis the enzyme differentiates into a pair of dimers (A/C and B/D dimers, respectively), with one closed (A or B) and one open subunit (C or D) per dimer. Cofactor–Substrate Complex Indicates Half-Site Reactivity within Each DimerWe next investigated the effects of substrate binding to the K. setae ECR tetramer complex and determined its ternary complex structure with the substrate analogue butyryl-CoA and NADPH at 1.7 Å resolution (Figure 3). The structure is overall very similar to the conformation of the ECR*NADPH binary complex with the noncrystallographic, pseudo-C2 cyclic symmetry (Figure 3a and Figure S1). It comprises two sets of open- and closed-form subunits that overlay very well with those of the ECR*NADPH binary complex (Figures S1 and S2). The NADPH cofactor appears to be bound to all active sites; however, only the closed-form subunits A and B also contain electron density for the complete butyryl-CoA thioester, while the open-form subunits (C and D) show only the adenine group electron density of the butyryl-CoA thioester (Figure 3a,b). The presence of the intact butyryl-CoA thioester in the active site of the closed-form subunits strongly suggests that the A and B conformations represent the Michaelis complex in which the substrate and cofactor are positioned for catalysis. In contrast, the open-form sub\n",

      "Source text: re of NADP+-bound ECR at cryogenic temperature and found that it is rather similar to that of the apo form structure, although NADP+ molecules are bound in all four subunits. We postulate that the same crystallization conditions used for both structures might have resulted in the same space group (P212121) with similar crystal contacts, which might have kept the NADP+ bound ECR tetramer in the apo form. The NADP+-bound subunits are less rigid in comparison, and some residues show greater variations (Figures S1 and S2). Cofactor Binding Breaks Tetramer Symmetry and Induces Formation of a Pair of DimersIn order to understand the effects of binding of NADPH, a cofactor before reaction as opposed to the spent cofactor NADP+ described above, we then determined the K. setae ECR-NADPH binary complex’s crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) at ambient temperature (Figure 2 and Table S1). (12−15) In all four subunits, NADPH binds with its adenine moiety in the oligomerization domain and spans the catalytic domain, where its nicotinamide moiety is located (Figure S5).Figure 2Figure 2. Binding of NADPH results in global and local conformational changes in K. setae ECR. (a) NADPH-bound tetramer complex that is organized as pair of dimers, a pair of closed (green) and open (orange) subunits, and another pair containing closed (gray) and open (blue) subunits. (b) The foreground dimer with open (orange)- and closed-form (green) subunits rotated by 30° from the view in (a). Each subunit is composed of a catalytic and an oligomerization domain. (c) Comparison of the putative substrate binding sites between the open- and closed-form subunits.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideNotably, NADPH binding breaks the dihedral D2 symmetry observed in the apo-form tetramer, while symmetry about the y axis is retained, resulting in a noncrystallographic, almost cyclic C2 symmetry (Figure S1). In the NADPH*ECR binary complex, each of the two dimers, A/C and B/D, loses its 2-fold symmetry, giving rise to closed (A and B) and open (C and D) subunits (Figure 2a,b and Figure S1). In the A and B subunits, the cofactor binding pocket is compressed inward, which seals the NADPH cofactor within the catalytic domain, resulting in a “closed-form” state (Figure 2b). On the other hand, the C and D subunits show open cofactor-binding pockets, referred to hereafter as an “open-form” state. The substrate-binding pocket in the open-form C or D subunit is more than 5 Å wider than the closed A or B subunit (Figure 2c). When they were taken together, these structures indicated that during catalysis the enzyme differentiates into a pair of dimers (A/C and B/D dimers, respectively), with one closed (A or B) and one open subunit (C or D) per dimer. Cofactor–Substrate Complex Indicates Half-Site Reactivity within Each DimerWe next investigated the effects of substrate binding to the K. setae ECR tetramer complex and determined its ternary complex structure with the substrate analogue butyryl-CoA and NADPH at 1.7 Å resolution (Figure 3). The structure is overall very similar to the conformation of the ECR*NADPH binary complex with the noncrystallographic, pseudo-C2 cyclic symmetry (Figure 3a and Figure S1). It comprises two sets of open- and closed-form subunits that overlay very well with those of the ECR*NADPH binary complex (Figures S1 and S2). The NADPH cofactor appears to be bound to all active sites; however, only the closed-form subunits A and B also contain electron density for the complete butyryl-CoA thioester, while the open-form subunits (C and D) show only the adenine group electron density of the butyryl-CoA thioester (Figure 3a,b). The presence of the intact butyryl-CoA thioester in the active site of the closed-form subunits strongly suggests that the A and B conformations represent the Michaelis complex in which the substrate and cofactor are positioned for catalysis. In contrast, the open-form sub\n",
