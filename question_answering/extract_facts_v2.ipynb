It is composed of a pair of dimers that take open and closed configurations, undergoing significant conformational rearrangement to achieve a catalytically active state. (1) Insight into the mode of action of ECRs, as well as the chemistry involved, has been limited by a dearth of high-resolution structures of ECRs in complex with catalytic intermediates and carboxylated products. The authors present four high-resolution structures of the K. setae ECR, one in the unliganded apo form, and three liganded forms of the enzyme: two binary complexes with reduced NADPH and oxidized NADP+, respectively, as well as a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA.Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers.While the elucidation of the structures is itself impressive, the authors then use these structures as a basis for detailed molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to reveal substantial conformational transitions that occur during the catalytic cycle. In brief, (1) the unliganded apo form of the enzyme is a symmetric homotetramer, composed of a dimer of dimers, with each subunit being comprised of two domains: a larger catalytic domain and a smaller oligomerization domain. The catalytic domains are at the periphery of the tetramer, and the associated active sites are open and accessible for cofactors and substrates in the apoenzyme.

      "Source text: a pair of asymmetric dimers. In all four subunits, NADPH spans both the catalytic and oligomerization domains, with its adenine moiety bound to the oligomerization domain and its nicotinamide moiety bound to the catalytic domain. (3) The cofactor–substrate complex indicates an additional layer of complexity: while NADPH appears to be bound to all four subunits, only two closed-form subunits show density for the complete thioester, whereas the two open-form subunits represent catalytically incompetent ternary complexes. QM/MM simulations indicate that the substrate is conformationally constrained in the closed-form subunits, and highly dynamic in the open-form subunits, suggesting half-site reactivity. (4) Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers. Removing the substrate from the closed-form subunits resulted in rapid conformational changes in just a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time, causing the closed-form subunits to transition to an open-form conformation, coupled with a twist motion of one subunit to the other in each dimer. In the A/C dimer, which opens its closed subunit first, this twisting motion was shown to rotate the catalytic domain of the now-empty open-form active site in subunit A, which would then be expected to push a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor in the C-subunit. Further simulations indicated coupling between the dynamics of each dimer pair in the tetrameric complex (Figure 2), that is regulated by the absence or release of substrate.Figure 2Figure 2.

      "Source text: a pair of asymmetric dimers. In all four subunits, NADPH spans both the catalytic and oligomerization domains, with its adenine moiety bound to the oligomerization domain and its nicotinamide moiety bound to the catalytic domain. (3) The cofactor–substrate complex indicates an additional layer of complexity: while NADPH appears to be bound to all four subunits, only two closed-form subunits show density for the complete thioester, whereas the two open-form subunits represent catalytically incompetent ternary complexes. QM/MM simulations indicate that the substrate is conformationally constrained in the closed-form subunits, and highly dynamic in the open-form subunits, suggesting half-site reactivity. (4) Most impressively from a conformational perspective, the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations indicate highly complex allosteric regulation, involving catalytically essential swing and twist motions of peripheral catalytic domains that are coupled both within and across pairs of dimers. Removing the substrate from the closed-form subunits resulted in rapid conformational changes in just a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time, causing the closed-form subunits to transition to an open-form conformation, coupled with a twist motion of one subunit to the other in each dimer. In the A/C dimer, which opens its closed subunit first, this twisting motion was shown to rotate the catalytic domain of the now-empty open-form active site in subunit A, which would then be expected to push a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor in the C-subunit. Further simulations indicated coupling between the dynamics of each dimer pair in the tetrameric complex (Figure 2), that is regulated by the absence or release of substrate.Figure 2Figure 2.

      "It has long been speculated that the SSUL modules interact with Rubisco by replacing RbcS2-4.\n",
      "Here we have reconstituted the Rubisco-CcmM complex and solved its structure.\n",
      "Contrary to expectation, the SSUL modules do not replace RbcS, but bind close to the equatorial region of Rubisco between RbcL dimers, linking Rubisco mols. and inducing phase sepn. into a liq.-like matrix.\n",
      "Disulfide bond formation in SSUL increases the network flexibility and is required for carboxysome function in vivo.\n",
      "Notably, the formation of the liq.-like condensate of Rubisco is mediated by dynamic interactions with the SSUL domains, rather than by low-complexity sequences, which typically mediate liq.-liq. phase sepn. in eukaryotes12,13.\n",

      "Source text: ynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, and dynamical networks to describe the allosteric activation of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) from the substrate-free form to the active ternary complex.\n",
      "IGPS is a heterodimeric bienzyme complex whose HisH subunit is responsible for hydrolyzing glutamine and delivering ammonia for the cyclase activity in HisF.\n",
      "Despite significant advances in understanding the underlying allosteric mechanism, essential mol. details of the long-range millisecond allosteric activation of IGPS remain hidden.\n",
      "Without using a priori information of the active state, our simulations uncover how IGPS, with the allosteric effector bound in HisF, spontaneously captures glutamine in a catalytically inactive HisH conformation, subsequently attains a closed HisF:HisH interface, and finally forms the oxyanion hole in HisH for efficient glutamine hydrolysis.\n",
      "We show that the combined effector and substrate binding dramatically decreases the conformational barrier assocd. with oxyanion hole formation, in line with the exptl. obsd. 4500-fold activity increase in glutamine hydrolysis.\n",
      "The allosteric activation is controlled by correlated time-evolving dynamic networks connecting the effector and substrate binding sites.\n",
      "This computational strategy tailored to describe millisecond events can be used to rationalize the effect of mutations on the allosteric regulation and guide IGPS engineering efforts. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38XpsVars74%253D&md5=9cf378e4a110e6bdf97b00b8b0c39449\n",

      "Source text: ContentsSignificanceAbstractData AvailabilityAcknowledgmentsSupporting InformationReferencesInformation & AuthorsMetrics & CitationsView OptionsReferencesMediaShareSignificanceCarboxylases capture and convert CO2, which makes them key enzymes in photosynthesis and the global carbon cycle. However, the question how enzymes bind atmospheric CO2 is still unsolved. We studied enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs), the fastest CO2-fixing enzymes in nature, using structural biology, biochemistry, and advanced computational methods. Ecrs create a highly specific CO2-binding pocket with 4 amino acids at the active site. The pocket controls the fate of the gaseous molecule during catalysis and shields the catalytic center from oxygen and water. This exquisite control makes Ecrs highly efficient carboxylases outcompeting RuBisCO, the key enzyme of photosynthesis, by an order of magnitude. Our findings define the atomic framework for the future development of CO2-converting catalysts in biology and chemistry.AbstractCarboxylases are biocatalysts that capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) under mild conditions and atmospheric concentrations at a scale of more than 400 Gt annually. However, how these enzymes bind and control the gaseous CO2 molecule during catalysis is only poorly understood. One of the most efficient classes of carboxylating enzymes are enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs), which outcompete the plant enzyme RuBisCO in catalytic efficiency and fidelity by more than an order of magnitude. Here we investigated the interactions of CO2 within the active site of Ecr from Kitasatospora setae. Combining experimental biochemistry, protein crystallography, and advanced computer simulations we show that 4 amino acids, N81, F170, E171, and H365, are required to create a highly efficient CO2-fixing enzyme. Together, these 4 residues anchor and position the CO2 molecule for the attack by a reactive enolate created during the catalytic cycle. Notably, a highly ordered water molecule plays an important role in an active site that is otherwise carefully shielded from water, which is detrimental to CO2 fixation. Altogether, our study reveals unprecedented molecular details of selective CO2 binding and C–C-bond formation during the catalytic cycle of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzyme. This knowledge provides the basis for the future development of catalytic frameworks for the capture and conversion of CO2 in biology and chemistry.Continue ReadingVIEW PDFFULL TEXTData AvailabilityData deposition: Crystallography, atomic coordinates, and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), http://www.rcsb.org/; PDB ID code: 6OWE.AcknowledgmentsD.A.S. and E.V.-M. acknowledge K.

      "Source text: ing catalysis, how is catalysis synchronized across the enzyme complex (i.e., across dimers A/C and B/D)? One intriguing aspect of the ECR tetramer structures is that the catalytic domains share a common interface of 1636 Å2 between the pairs of dimers (Figure 5a,b), suggesting that they move together as rigid bodies.Figure 5Figure 5. Inter- and intradimer communications drive fast CO2 fixation by K. setae ECR. (a) Two distinct sets of communications: interdimer interactions between the catalytic domains from two dimers (purple arrows) and intradimer communication between the open and closed subunits within each dimer (brown arrows). (b) Interdimer catalytic domain interface and positions of selected amino acids that were mutated in this study to affect the interface between the two catalytic domains (open-form subunit in orange and closed form subunit in gray). The right panel shows the mutual H-bonding interaction between N218 and N157 from open- and closed-form subunits and H-bonding between E151 and the N atom from the protein backbone. (c) Alignment of ECR protein sequences from the primary (upper row) and the secondary (lower row) metabolisms represented as sequence logos. The numbering of residues, above the first row, is according to their position in the K. setae ECR. (d) Communication between the closed (green) and open (orange) subunits across the two dimers of the K. setae ECR. In the closed conformation the contacts between NADPH-H365-E165 and K332 of the adjacent open subunit allow for the correct intradimer communication. In the open conformation the communication network is compromised, as indicated by the increased distances between the amino acid side chains that cause the incorrect positioning of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWhat are the molecular determinants that synchronize catalysis across the pair of open/closed form dimers? The intercatalytic domain interface is predominantly hydrophobic with some electrostatic interactions (Figure 5b). Most notable are N218, which forms a hydrogen bond to N157 of the adjacent subunit of the other dimer, and E151 interacting with the backbone nitrogen atom of N133 (and/or A134) of the neighboring subunit of the other dimer (Figure 5b). A multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W (20) showed that E151, N218, and N157 are highly conserved in ECRs from primary (i.e., central carbon) metabolism with faster CO2-fixation kinetics, but not in ECRs from secondary metabolism with an average kcat of 1.2 s–1 (Figure 5c), which raised the question about their potential role in promoting catalysis in primary metabolic ECRs.Notably, mutation of these residues that are more than 20 Å away from the active site dramatically affected the kinetic parameters of K. setae ECR (Table 1). In the E151D variant, the kcat value decreased by a factor of 5, demonstrating that weakening the interaction between catalytic domains has profound effects on the enzyme’s catalytic rate. Mutations that targeted the asparagine interaction network also showed substantial effects on the catalytic rate and affected the KM value of substrate binding. Most notable were a N218E single variant and E151D/N157E/N218E triple variants that decreased the kcat values by more than 25- and 100-fold, respectively, highlighting that communication through the interface of the catalytic domains of the pair of dimers is an essential determinant of the catalytic rate in K. setae ECR.\n",
