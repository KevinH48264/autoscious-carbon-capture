      "Carboxylases are biocatalysts that capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) under mild conditions and atmospheric concentrations at a scale of more than 400 Gt annually. However, how these enzymes bind and control the gaseous CO2 molecule during catalysis is only poorly understood. One of the most efficient classes of carboxylating enzymes are enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs), which outcompete the plant enzyme RuBisCO in catalytic efficiency and fidelity by more than an order of magnitude. Here we investigated the interactions of CO2 within the active site of Ecr from Kitasatospora setae Combining experimental biochemistry, protein crystallography, and advanced computer simulations we show that 4 amino acids, N81, F170, E171, and H365, are required to create a highly eff\n",

      "How a soil microbe could rev up artificial photosynthesis\n",
      "by Glennda Chui, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n",
      "A close-up look at Kitasatospora setae, a bacterium isolated from soil in Japan. These bacteria fix carbon—turn carbon dioxide from their environment into biomolecules they need to survive—thanks to enzymes called ECRs. Researchers are looking for ways to harness and improve ECRs for artificial photosynthesis to produce fuels, antibiotics and other products. Credit: Y. Takahashi & Y. Iwai\n",
      "Plants rely on a process called carbon fixation—turning carbon dioxide from the air into carbon-rich biomolecules—for their very existence. That's the whole point of photosynthesis, and a cornerstone of the vast interlocking system that cycles carbon through plants, animals, microbes and the atmosphere to sustain life on Earth.\n",
      "But the carbon fixing champs are not plants, but soil bacteria. Some bacterial enzymes carry out a key step in carbon fixation 20 times faster than plant enzymes do, and figuring out how they do this could help scientists develop forms of artificial photosynthesis to convert the greenhouse gas into fuels, fertilizers, antibiotics and other products.\n",
      "Now a team of researchers from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Germany, DOE's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the University of Concepción in Chile has discovered how a bacterial enzyme—a molecular machine that facilitates chemical reactions—revs up to perform this feat.\n",
      "Rather than grabbing carbon dioxide molecules and attaching them to biomolecules one at a time, they found, this enzyme consists of pairs of molecules that work in sync, like the hands of a juggler who simultaneously tosses and catches balls, to get the job done faster. One member of each enzyme pair opens wide to catch a set of reaction ingredients while the other closes over its captured ingredients and carries out the carbon-fixing reaction; then, they switch roles in a continual cycle.\n",
      "A single spot of molecular \"glue\" holds each pair of enzymatic hands together so they can alternate opening and closing in a coordinated way, the team discovered, while a twisting motion helps hustle ingredients and finished products in and out of the pockets where the reactions take place. When both glue and twist are present, the carbon-fixing reaction goes 100 times faster than without them.\n",
      "\"This bacterial enzyme is the most efficient carbon fixer that we know of, and we came up with a neat explanation of what it can do,\" said Soichi Wakatsuki, a professor at SLAC and Stanford and one of the senior leaders of the study, which was published in ACS Central Science this week.\n",
      "\"Some of the enzymes in this family act slowly but in a very specific way to produce just one product,\" he said. \"Others are much faster and can craft chemical building blocks for all sorts of products. Now that we know the mechanism, we can engineer enzymes that combine the best features of both approaches and do a very fast job with all sorts of starting materials.\"\n",
      "Improving on nature\n",
      "The enzyme the team studied is part of a family called enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases, or ECRs. It comes from soil bacteria called Kitasatospora setae, which in addition to their carbon-fixing skills can also produce antibiotics.\n",
      "Wakatsuki heard about this enzyme family half a dozen years ago from Tobias Erb of the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Germany and Yasuo Yoshikuni of JGI. Erb's research team had been working to develop bioreactors for artificial photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into all sorts of products.\n",

      "What's more, he said, the step in natural photosynthesis that fixes CO2 from the air, which relies on an enzyme called Rubisco, is a bottleneck that bogs the whole chain of photosynthetic reactions down. So using speedy ECR enzymes to carry out this step, and engineering them to go even faster, could bring a big boost in efficiency.\n",

      "Source text: reen with orange—to turn carbon dioxide from the microbe's environment into biomolecules it needs to survive. A new study shows that a spot of molecular glue and a timely swing and twist allow these pairs to sync their motions and fix carbon 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis. Credit: H. DeMirci et al\n",
      "The simulations revealed that the opening and closing of the enzyme's two parts don't just involve molecular glue, but also twisting motions around the central axis of each enzyme pair, Wakatsuki said.\n",
      "\"This twist is almost like a rachet that can push a finished product out or pull a new set of ingredients into the pocket where the reaction takes place,\" he said. Together, the twisting and synchronization of the enzyme pairs allow them to fix carbon 100 times a second.\n",
      "The ECR enzyme family also includes a more versatile branch that can interact with many different kinds of biomolecules to produce a variety of products. But since they aren't held together by molecular glue, they can't coordinate their movements and therefore operate much more slowly.\n",
      "\"If we can increase the rate of those sophisticated reactions to make new biomolecules,\" Wakatsuki said, \"that would be a significant jump in the field.\"\n",
      "From static shots to fluid movies\n",
      "So far the experiments have produced static snapshots of the enzyme, the reaction ingredients and the final products in various configurations.\n",
      "\"Our dream experiment,\" Wakatsuki said, \"would be to combine all the ingredients as they flow into the path of the X-ray laser beam so we could watch the reaction take place in real time.\"\n",
      "The team actually tried that at SACLA, he said, but it didn't work. \"The CO2 molecules are really small, and they move so fast that it's hard to catch the moment when they attach to the substrate,\" he said. \"Plus the X-ray laser beam is so strong that we couldn't keep the ingredients in it long enough for the reaction to take place. When we pressed hard to do this, we managed to break the crystals.\"\n",
      "An upcoming high-energy upgrade to LCLS will likely solve that problem, he added, with pulses that arrive much more frequently—a million times per second—and can be individually adjusted to the ideal strength for each sample.\n",
      "Wakatsuki said his team continues to collaborate with Erb's group, and it's working with the LCLS sample delivery group and with researchers at the SLAC-Stanford cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilities to find a way to make this approach work.\n",

In the NADPH*ECR binary complex, each of the two dimers, A/C and B/D, loses its 2-fold symmetry, giving rise to closed (A and B) and open (C and D) subunits ( Figure S1).

The structure is overall very similar to the conformation of the ECR*NADPH binary complex with the noncrystallographic, pseudo-C 2 cyclic symmetry ( Figure 3a and Figure S1).

It comprises two sets of open-and closed-form subunits that overlay very well with those of the ECR*NADPH binary complex ( Figures S1 and S2). The NADPH cofactor appears to be bound to all active sites; however, only the closed-form subunits A and B also contain electron density for the complete butyryl-CoA thioester, while the open-form subunits (C and D) show only the adenine group electron density of the butyrylCoA thioester (Figure 3a,b). ...View in full-textContext 9... we inspected CoA-thioester binding in the open-form subunits, we also observed the electron density in the adenine binding pocket of the neighboring closed form subunits (A or B), strongly indicating that the CoAthioester was bound (Figure 3g, right inset). However, the electron density beyond the adenine ring becomes invisible, suggesting that the part of the CoA molecule reaching into the open-form subunit's active site remains flexible and disordered, which is corroborated by the higher B-factors of the catalytic domain ( Figure 1, bottom right). ...View in full-textContext 10... characterize the dynamics, we compared the projections of all 10 dimer trajectories on PC1 and PC2. Dimer A/C opens its closed subunit first, associated with PC1, followed by a twist motion characterized by PC2 in some of the simulations ( Figure 4d and Figure S10).

In the NADPH*ECR binary complex, each of the two dimers, A/C and B/D, loses its 2-fold symmetry, giving rise to closed (A and B) and open (C and D) subunits ( Figure S1). In the A and B subunits, the cofactor binding pocket is compressed inward, which seals the NADPH cofactor within the catalytic domain, resulting in a \"closed-form\" state ( Figure 2b). ...View in full-textContext 7... next investigated the effects of substrate binding to the K. setae ECR tetramer complex and determined its ternary complex structure with the substrate analogue butyryl-CoA and NADPH at 1.7 Å resolution ( Figure 3).

The NADPH cofactor appears to be bound to all active sites; however, only the closed-form subunits A and B also contain electron density for the complete butyryl-CoA thioester, while the open-form subunits (C and D) show only the adenine group electron density of the butyrylCoA thioester (Figure 3a,b). ...View in full-textContext 9... we inspected CoA-thioester binding in the open-form subunits, we also observed the electron density in the adenine binding pocket of the neighboring closed form subunits (A or B), strongly indicating that the CoAthioester was bound (Figure 3g, right inset). However, the electron density beyond the adenine ring becomes invisible, suggesting that the part of the CoA molecule reaching into the open-form subunit's active site remains flexible and disordered, which is corroborated by the higher B-factors of the catalytic domain ( Figure 1, bottom right). ...View in full-textContext 10... characterize the dynamics, we compared the projections of all 10 dimer trajectories on PC1 and PC2.

      "Source text: tory birds is thought to rely on a radical pair reaction inside the blue-light photoreceptor protein cryptochrome. The sensitivity of such a sensor to weak external magnetic fields is determined by a variety of magnetic interactions, including electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions. Here, we investigate the implications of thermal motion, focusing on fluctuations in the dihedral and librational angles of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and tryptophan (Trp) radicals in cryptochrome 4a from European robin (Erithacus rubecula, ErCry4a) and pigeon (Columba livia, ClCry4a) and cryptochrome 1 from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCry1). Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory-derived hyperfine interactions are used to calculate the quantum yield of radical pair recombination dependent on the direction of the geomagnetic field. This quantity and various dynamical parameters are compared for [FAD•- Trp•+] in ErCry4a, ClCry4a, and AtCry1, with TrpC or TrpD being the third and fourth components of the tryptophan triad/tetrad in the respective proteins. We find that (i) differences in the average dihedral angles in the radical pairs are small, (ii) the librational motions of TrpC•+ in the avian cryptochromes are appreciably smaller than in AtCry1, (iii) the rapid vibrational motions of the radicals leading to strong fluctuations in the hyperfine couplings affect the spin dynamics depending on the usage of instantaneous or time-averaged interactions. Future investigations of radical pair compass sensitivity should therefore not be based on single snapshots of the protein structure but should include the ensemble properties of the hyperfine interactions.ViewGet access to 30 million figuresJoin ResearchGate to access over 30 million figures and 160+ million publications – all in one place.Join for free\n",
