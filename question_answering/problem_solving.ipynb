      "In order to overcome the climate crisis, two measures are required: The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and removal of CO2 from the earth atmosphere. The latter is the goal of Tobias Erb's research group at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg. Their approaches not only aim to benefit climate protection, but also to secure sustainability in the long term: to filter CO2 from the air and make it usable for technology.\n",

      "Filtering CO2 efficiently from the air - nature can do this through photosynthesis, converting CO2 into biomass. Unlike industrial technologies which can only use the gas in a highly concentrated form (which in turn consumes fossil energy), photosynthesis works directly with ambient air containing only 0.4% gaseous carbon dioxide. Its secret lies in the enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts to mediate specific chemical reactions, such as the fixation of CO2. In photosynthesis, this reaction is driven by the enzyme RubisCO. However, the efficiency of natural photosynthesis is not very high: in more than a fourth of all cases, RubisCO metabolizes oxygen from the air, which is a strong competitor of CO2 in this reaction.ECR enzymes are faster and more precise than RubisCoTherefore, the Max Planck researchers in Marburg have decided on alternatives to RubisCO. Enoyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase enzymes (ECRs) are much more efficient than RubisCO and do not make mistakes with oxygen.\n",
      "len(chunk):  ake mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase. Using a combined approach of structural biology, biochemistry and computer simulations, they were able to understand for the first time how the enzyme binds and converts CO2.Teamwork in the active centre\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

Its secret lies in the enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts to mediate specific chemical reactions, such as the fixation of CO2. In photosynthesis, this reaction is driven by the enzyme RubisCO. However, the efficiency of natural photosynthesis is not very high: in more than a fourth of all cases, RubisCO metabolizes oxygen from the air, which is a strong competitor of CO2 in this reaction.ECR enzymes are faster and more precise than RubisCoTherefore, the Max Planck researchers in Marburg have decided on alternatives to RubisCO.

      "Text: ake mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase. Using a combined approach of structural biology, biochemistry and computer simulations, they were able to understand for the first time how the enzyme binds and converts CO2.Teamwork in the active centre\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

      "Text: ake mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase. Using a combined approach of structural biology, biochemistry and computer simulations, they were able to understand for the first time how the enzyme binds and converts CO2.Teamwork in the active centre\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

In order to investigate ice sheets and their interaction with the climate, we are developing a climate model in which the extent of the ice sheets changes over time. Such changes and interactions have so far been insufficiently represented in conventional climate models.\n",

      "len(chunk):  synthetic biology. Here we used bioinformatics to identify a “sleeping carboxylase function” in the superfamily of medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR), i.e. enzymes that possess a low carboxylation side activity next to their original enzyme reaction. We show that propionyl-CoA synthase from Erythrobacter sp. NAP1, as well as an acrylyl-CoA reductase from Nitrosopumilus maritimus possess carboxylation yields of 3 ± 1 and 4.5 ± 0.9%. We use rational design to engineer these enzymes further into carboxylases by increasing interactions of the proteins with CO2 and suppressing diffusion of water to the active site. The engineered carboxylases show improved CO2-binding and kinetic parameters comparable to naturally existing CO2-fixing enzymes. Our results provide a strategy to develop novel CO2-fixing enzymes and shed light on the emergence of natural carboxylases during evolution.To harvest atmospheric CO2 as a sustainable carbon source for (bio)catalytic and (bio)technological applications, (1−5) it is necessary to extend the repertoire of CO2-fixing reactions. One possibility is to engineer a carboxylation function into the scaffold of non-CO2-fixing enzymes. Generally, the interaction of CO2 with proteins is poorly understood. (6) However, for enoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase from Kitasatospora setae (ECRKs), four conserved amino acids that form a CO2-binding pocket at the active site were described recently (7) (Figure 1a). These four amino acids anchor and position the CO2 molecule during catalysis, in which a reactive enolate is formed that attacks the CO2. (8)Figure 1Figure 1. CO2-binding pocket of ECR and its partial conservation in the MDR superfamily. (a) Active site of ECRKs. (7) The CO2-binding pocket is defined by four conserved residues (Asn81, Phe170, Glu171, His365). CO2 was modeled into the structure. (b) Maximum-likelihood tree of the MDR superfamily (9) with (potential) CO2-binding enzyme families highlighted in color.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideTo identify enzyme scaffolds capable of binding CO2 beyond the ECR enzyme family, we searched homologues of the MDR superfamily for the CO2-binding motif. Our search revealed two enzyme families that show the potential to bind CO2, the propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and an archaeal enoyl-CoA reductase (AER) family (Figure 1b). The PCS family clusters closely to ECRs and shows a fully conserved CO2-binding motif across individual family members (Figure S1). The AER family is more distantly related to the ECR family, and selected homologues only contain one or two of the four conserved residues of the CO2-binding pocket (Figure S2). We decided to test selected members of these enzyme families in their CO2-fixing capabilities.PCS is a three-domain fusion enzyme that catalyzes the overall conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA (10) (Figure 2a). The enzyme forms a central reaction chamber, in which three subsequent reactions take place in a synchronized fashion. (11) When we assayed PCS from Erythrobacter sp. NAP1, PCSEN, at 4.4 mM dissolved CO2, we detected minor amounts of methylmalonyl-CoA besides the main product propionyl-CoA. Incorporation of 13CO2-label confirmed the latent carboxylation activity of PCSEN (Figure 2b). Notably, the carboxylation function was not limited to the Erythrobacter enzyme, but was also detected with PCS from Chloroflexus aurantiacus (PCSCa, Table S1).Figure 2Figure 2. PCSEN possesses a “sleeping carboxylase function”. (a) Reaction sequence of PCS.

We directly tested the reductase domain for carboxylation activity with an E1027Q variant of PCSEN (PCSEN_ΔDH) that is unable to generate acrylyl-CoA. When PCSEN_ΔDH was provided with external acrylyl-CoA and 4.4 mM dissolved CO2, the enzyme showed a carboxylation yield (defined as percentage yield of carboxylated product compared with total product formed, including reduced side product) of 3 ± 1% (Table 1). This showed that the reductase domain is able to carboxylate acrylyl-CoA directly.Table 1.

KM values were determined from a Michaelis–Menten fit of at least 18 data points, with fixed acrylyl-CoA concentrations for KM_CO2 (Figures S3 and S4, Table S2 for kcat. values). Carboxylation yields are calculated from mean carboxylation yields over five time points in three replicates. Data are mean ± s.d. CO2 concentrations were calculated. n.m., not measurable.To improve further the carboxylation efficiency of PCSEN, we compared the active site of PCSEN (PDB: 6EQO) with ECRKs. While the NADPH binding site, as well as the four CO2-binding pocket residues are structurally conserved (Figure 2c), we noticed differences in the second shell of the active site. ECRKs features a small hydrophilic residue (Thr82), which interacts with Asn81 that stabilizes CO2 through its carboxyamide NH2 group. The corresponding residue in PCSEN is occupied by an aspartate (Asp1302). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that Asp1302 in PCSEN forms a strong anionic hydrogen bond to the carboxamide NH2 group of Asn1301 (Figures 3a and S5), locking Asn1301 in a position which prevents interactions with CO2. This finding is in line with the fact that we could not determine an apparent KM for CO2 with PCSEN_ΔDH and that replacing Asn1301 by an aspartate abolished carboxylation activity.Figure 3Figure 3. Directed mutagenesis to exploit the carboxylation activity of PCSEN. (a) Representative snapshot from the MD simulation of the active site in wild type PCSEN. (b) Active site model of PCSEN D1302S to unlock Asn1301. (c) Active site of wild type PCSEN. (d) Active site model of PCSEN T1753M to restrict water access to the active site. Acrylyl-CoA and CO2 were modeled into the active site.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideWe aimed at unlocking Asn1301 from its fixed position by replacing Asp1302 with different small hydrophilic residues. PCSEN_ΔDH variant D1302S (Figure 3b) showed an increased carboxylation yield of 20.9 ± 0.7% at 4.4 mM dissolved CO2, and notably also Michaelis–Menten-like behavior with CO2 at an apparent KM_CO2 of 27 ± 5 mM (Table 1). Together with MD simulations that showed a more flexible asparagine residue (Figure S5) this demonstrated that unlocking Asn1301 improves CO2-binding and carboxylation efficiency in PCSEN.Another, equally important catalytic principle in carboxylases is th\n",
      "len(chunk):  ple in carboxylases is the exclusion of water from the active site to minimize protonation reactions which would prematurely quench C–C bond formation. (7,14−16) In ECRKs, a conserved methionine (Met356) restricts access of water to the CO2-binding pocket. In PCSEN, this residue is a threonine, which presumably allows water to enter the active site and displace the CO2 molecule (Figure 3c). When we introduced the methionine in PCSEN (PCSEN_ΔDH T1753M, Figure 3d), carboxylation yield increased to 10 ± 2% at 4.4 mM dissolved CO2. When combining the D1302S with the T1573M mutation, the carboxylation yield of PCSEN_ΔDH further increased up to 69 ± 3% at 4.4 mM CO2 (Table 1). Under saturating CO2 concentrations (i.e., 44 mM CO2), PCSEN_ΔDH D1302S T1753M showed a carboxylation yield of 94.5 ± 0.7%, demonstrating that we successfully converted the reductase domain into a carboxylase. During engineering, the kcat. of reduction was strongly decreased, while the apparent kcat. for carboxylation was maintained (Table S2) and falls in the range of naturally existing ECRs. (4,17) The engineered carboxylase domain also improved carboxylation yield in the context of the overall reaction of PCSEN (Supporting Information I).We next investigated the carboxylation potential in the AER enzyme family of unknown function. We chose Nmar_1565 (AERNm), a homologue from Nitrosopumilus maritimus, in which two of the four amino acids of the CO2-binding motif, namely Phe122 and Glu123, are conserved (Figure 4a,b). Although no function was assigned to AERNm so far, we speculated that the enzyme might catalyze the reduction of acrylyl-CoA in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hyroxybutyrate cycle of N. maritimus. (18,19) Indeed, the enzyme reduced acrylyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA at an apparent kcat. of 0.99 ± 0.11 s–1, confirming its reductase function.Figure 4Figure 4. Awakening the “sleeping carboxylase function” in AERNm. (a) Active sites of AERNm (salmon) and ECRKs (blue).

(b) Model of the AERNm wild type active site carrying an Asp50 instead of a conserved Asn. (c) Model of the AERNm D50N active site. Homology models were created with an ECR from Streptomyces sp. NRRL 2288 (PDB: 4y0k (21)) using SWISS-MODEL. (22) Acrylyl-CoA and CO2 were modeled into the active site.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAERNm activity was very sensitive to salt and buffer composition (Supporting Information II). When we incubated the enzyme with NaHCO3, at concentrations corresponding to 1.31 mM free CO2, activity dropped 10-fold. However, under these conditions AERNm showed a latent carboxylation activity and converted acrylyl-CoA into methylmalonyl-CoA at a carboxylation yield of 4.5 ± 0.9% (Table 2), despite the lack of two of the four amino acid residues of the CO2-binding motif. To increase the carboxylation efficiency of AERNm we decided to rebuild the CO2-binding pocket through introduction of asparagine and histidine. Reintroduction of histidine failed due to inactive protein, which might be a result of interrupted second-shell interactions to Thr307 or steric clashes. However, replacing Asp50 by asparagine increased carboxylation yield dramatically (to 82 ± 5%, Figure 4c, Table 2). The increase in catalytic activity in AERNm D50N was accompanied by an improved KM_CO2 (0.18 ± 0.03 mM), indicating increased CO2-binding. AERNm D50N performed best in 100 mM phosphate buffer, where it showed kcat. and carboxylation yields comparable to those of naturally existing carboxylases, such as RubisCO (20) (Table 2).Table 2.

      "len(chunk):  arboxylation and reduction activity. KM_CO2 values were determined from a Michaelis–Menten fit of at least 18 data points with a fixed concentration of acrylyl-CoA (Figure S6, Table S3 for kcat. values). Carboxylation yields were calculated from the mean carboxylation ratio over five time points in three replicates. Data are mean ± s.d. CO2 concentrations were calculated. n.m., not measurable.In conclusion, we successfully reshaped the energy landscape of acrylyl-CoA reductases from the thermodynamically favored product propionyl-CoA (ΔrG′0 ≈ −63 kJ/mol) to the disfavored methylmalonyl-CoA (ΔrG′0 ≈ −43 kJ/mol). (23) Our engineering efforts show that improving CO2-binding (reduced energy barrier for carboxylation) and minimizing side reaction with water (increased energy barrier for reduction) are both required to establish a carboxylation activity in the scaffold of different reductases. This is in line with the idea that in catalysis stabilization of favorable transition states (“positive catalysis”) and destabilization of unwanted transition states (“negative catalysis”) are both important, (24−26) as further supported by the finding that suppression of competing protonation side reactions is essential for efficient CO2-fixation in ECRKs and 2-ketopropyl coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase. (14−16)On a broader picture, our findings also raise questions about the emergence of natural carboxylases. How did carboxylation functions naturally evolve in the scaffold of proteins, such as RubisCO or ECR? It has been suggested that these enzymes originated from non-CO2-fixing ancestors. (27,28) Our data provides experimental evidence for this evolutionary scenario by demonstrating that the MDR superfamily, to which ECR belongs, naturally possesses the capacity to interact with the CO2-molecule. It apparently takes only a few mutations to transform latent carboxylases that convert CO2 at low efficiency and nonphysiological CO2 concentrations into decent CO2-fixing enzymes.Another apparent question is why PCS and AER would possess a “sleeping carboxylase function”? One explanation might be that the latent carboxylation activity was selected for. PCS operates in the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle in C. aurantiacus and a modified version thereof in Erythrobacter sp. NAP1 (Figure S7a), (29,30) while AERNm presumably works in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hyroxybutyrate cycle in N. maritimus (Figure S7b). (18) Bioenergetic considerations suggest that even a low carboxylation activity would increase biomass yield of these organisms, which thrive at a constantly low energy supply (18) (Supporting Information III).In summary, our proof-of-principle study demonstrates that it is possible to exploit the active site of reductases to create novel carboxylases. This opens the possibility for the future engineering of novel CO2-fixing enzymes that could find application in biocatalysis and synthetic biology (e.g., in artificial pathways for the conversion of CO2 (31,32)).Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsReferencesThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b03431.Experimental details, biochemical enzyme characterization, compound synthesis, analytical HPLC methods, bioinformatics methods, supporting figures and tables (PDF)ja9b03431_si_001.pdf (875.46 kb)\n",

      "BACKGROUND:\n",
      "The Medium-chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases (MDR) form a protein superfamily whose size and complexity defeats traditional means of subclassification; it currently has over 15000 members in the databases, the pairwise sequence identity is typically around 25%, there are members from all kingdoms of life, the chain-lengths vary as does the oligomericity, and the members are partaking in a multitude of biological processes.\n",
      "There are profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) available for detecting MDR superfamily members, but none for determining which MDR family each protein belongs to.\n",
      "The current torrential influx of new sequence data enables elucidation of more and more protein families, and at an increasingly fine granularity.\n",
      "However, gathering good quality training data usually requires manual attention by experts and has therefore been the rate limiting step for expanding the number of available models.\n",
      "RESULTS:\n",
      "We have developed an automated algorithm for HMM refinement that produces stable and reliable models for protein families.\n",
      "This algorithm uses relationships found in data to generate confident seed sets.\n",
      "Using this algorithm we have produced HMMs for 86 distinct MDR families and 34 of their subfamilies which can be used in automated annotation of new sequences.\n",
      "We f\n",

      "We find that MDR forms with 2 Zn2+ ions in general are dehydrogenases, while MDR forms with no Zn2+ in general are reductases.\n",
      "Furthermore, in Bacteria MDRs without Zn2+ are more frequent than those with Zn2+, while the opposite is true for eukaryotic MDRs, indicating that Zn2+ has been recruited into the MDR superfamily after the initial life kingdom separations.\n",
      "We have also developed a web site http://mdr-enzymes.org that provides textual and numeric search against various characterised MDR family properties, as well as sequence scan functions for reliable classification of novel MDR sequences.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS:\n",
      "Our method of refinement can be readily applied to create stable and reliable HMMs for both MDR and other protein families, and to confidently subdivide large and complex protein superfamilies.\n",
      "HMMs created using this algorithm correspond to evolutionary entities, making resolution of overlapping models straightforward.\n",
      "The implementation and support scripts for running the algorithm on computer clusters are available as open source software, and the database files underlying the web site are freely downloadable.\n",

      "The cornerstone of autotrophy, the CO2-fixing enzyme, D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), is hamstrung by slow catalysis and confusion between CO2 and O2 as substrates, an \"abominably perplexing\" puzzle, in Darwin's parlance.\n",

      "However, increasing structural similarity between the carboxylation transition state and its carboxyketone product exposes the carboxyketone to the strong binding required to stabilize the transition state and causes the carboxyketone intermediate to bind so tightly that its cleavage to products is slowed.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:\n",
      "The Medium-chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases (MDR) form a protein superfamily whose size and complexity defeats traditional means of subclassification; it currently has over 15000 members in the databases, the pairwise sequence identity is typically around 25%, there are members from all kingdoms of life, the chain-lengths vary as does the oligomericity, and the members are partaking in a multitude of biological processes.\n",
      "There are profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) available for detecting MDR superfamily members, but none for determining which MDR family each protein belongs to.\n",
      "The current torrential influx of new sequence data enables elucidation of more and more protein families, and at an increasingly\n",
      "len(chunk):  s, and at an increasingly fine granularity.\n",
      "However, gathering good quality training data usually requires manual attention by experts and has therefore been the rate limiting step for expanding the number of available models.\n",
      "RESULTS:\n",
      "We have developed an automated algorithm for HMM refinement that produces stable and reliable models for protein families.\n",
      "This algorithm uses relationships found in data to generate confident seed sets.\n",
      "Using this algorithm we have produced HMMs for 86 distinct MDR families and 34 of their subfamilies which can be used in automated annotation of new sequences.\n",
      "We find that MDR forms with 2 Zn2+ ions in general are dehydrogenases, while MDR forms with no Zn2+ in general are reductases.\n",
      "Furthermore, in Bacteria MDRs without Zn2+ are more frequent than those with Zn2+, while the opposite is true for eukaryotic MDRs, indicating that Zn2+ has been recruited into the MDR superfamily after the initial life kingdom separations.\n",
      "We have also developed a web site http://mdr-enzymes.org that provides textual and numeric search against various characterised MDR family properties, as well as sequence scan functions for reliable classification of novel MDR sequences.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS:\n",
      "Our method of refinement can be readily applied to create stable and reliable HMMs for both MDR and other protein families, and to confidently subdivide large and complex protein superfamilies.\n",
      "HMMs created using this algorithm correspond to evolutionary entities, making resolution of overlapping models straightforward.\n",
      "The implementation and support scripts for running the algorithm on computer clusters are available as open source software, and the database files underlying the web site are freely downloadable.\n",

      "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) is arguably one of the most abundant proteins in the biosphere and a key enzyme in the global carbon cycle.\n",
      "Although RubisCO has been intensively studied, its evolutionary origins and rise as Nature's most dominant carbon dioxide (CO2)-fixing enzyme still remain in the dark.\n",
      "In this review we will bring together biochem., structural, physiol., microbiol., as well as phylogenetic data to speculate on the evolutionary roots of the CO2-fixation reaction of RubisCO, the emergence of RubisCO-based autotrophic CO2-fixation in the context of the Calvin cycle, and the further evolution of RubisCO into the 'RubisCOsome', a complex of various proteins assembling and interacting with the enzyme to improve its operational capacity (functionality) under different biol. and environmental conditions. >> More from SciFinder ®https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2sXhtlarurnE&md5=552560a7f6c3fb172efc0efc798f4fa428Schada\n",

      "At the same time, atm. CO2 is also a cheap and readily available carbon source that can in principle be used to synthesize value-added products.\n",
      "However, as uncatalyzed chem. CO2-fixation reactions usually require quite harsh conditions to functionalize the CO2 mol., not many processes have been developed that make use of CO2.\n",

      "Facts: To study the switching between the open and closed forms of the ternary complex, we used computer simulations. Starting from the ternary crystal structure with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, we modeled the natural substrate crotonyl-CoA to carry out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the catalytic active enzyme (see Supplementary Methods). In our simulations, the closed subunit remained closed and maintained crotonyl-CoA in the active site when the dynamics of the substrate were restrained to maintain specific protein–substrate/cofactor interactions. However, in simulations without substrate restraints, the acyl moiety of the substrate left the active site, resulting in a conformational change of the closed subunit to the open form.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",

      "To evaluate the substrate’s flexibility in the open- and closed-form subunits, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations on a dimer of subunits A and C that account for the electronic degrees of freedom of the substrate were combined with MM simulations of the pair of dimers (tetramer) with substrates initially modeled in the open and bound closed subunits to reach longer time scales. These simulations showed that the substrate in the closed subunit had significantly lower temperature factors (B-factors) in comparison to that in the open subunit (Figures S6–S8 and Movies S1a–e and S2a–e). In the open subunit, the acyl moiety shows a high degree of flexibility in the active site, in agreement with the higher B-factors observed in crystal structures.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",

      "In summary, computer simulations and kinetic data of the triple variant indicate that coupling the dynamics of the two dimers is conferred by three conserved amino acids in ECRs from primary metabolism (E151, N157, and N218) and is essential to reach fast CO2 fixation kinetics in comparison to their counterparts from secondary metabolism that lack those residues.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Notably, when we used crotonyl-panthetheine, a truncated substrate lacking the adenosine moiety, a comparable decrease in kcat value was also observed for the WT enzyme, suggesting that substrate interactions at the adenine binding pocket indeed contribute to catalysis.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when we compared the kinetics of the WT enzyme with a truncated substrate to that of triple variant K296A/R303A/Y328F, in which adenosine binding was completely disturbed, the two variants behaved almost identically, strongly supporting the argument that binding of the adenine residue of the CoA substrate in the WT is important for high catalytic activity.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "We noticed that the substrate’s adenine binding pocket is directly followed by a loop, which carries a lysine residue (K332) that interacts with the neighboring subunit’s active site. K332 from the open-form subunit engages in a hydrogen-bonding network with the nicotinamide of the NADPH cofactor bound to the closed-form subunit through Q165 and H365 of the neighboring subunit (Figure 5d). These interactions are not observed in the active site of the open-form subunit (Figure 5d), raising the question of whether the hydrogen-bonding network connected to the adenine binding pocket might be necessary for catalysis.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "In variants K332A and Q165A, kcat was decreased by 2–3-fold, and for K332A, an additional increase in the apparent KM for crotonyl-CoA was observed, indicating some effect of these residues on the catalytic rate (as well as substrate binding in case of K332) (Table 2). When we tested these variants again with the truncated substrate analogue crotonyl-pantetheine, the catalytic activity in the Q165A variant was reduced by 4-fold, while that of the K332A variant was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the WT with a truncated substrate. More notably, the KM had not changed much between the WT and the two different variants (where it has even slightly improved), strongly suggesting that Q165 and K332 are not involved in substrate accommodation but rather synchronization of catalysis between open and closed subunits within the dimer. In conclusion, adenine binding and the loop carrying the residues K332 and Q165 are necessary to synchronize catalysis between the two subunits within the dimer to drive fast CO2 fixation in the K. setae ECR, providing the molecular basis of how catalysis might be synchronized between the open- and closed-form subunits within one dimer.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "Our structural studies of the K. setae ECR revealed unprecedented details on the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient and fastest CO2-fixing enzymes. During catalysis, the enzyme complex differentiates into distinct functional subunits. The binding of the NADPH cofactor and substrates forces the homotetrameric apo enzyme into a pair of dimers. Each dimer is constituted of open- and closed-form subunits. In the closed-form subunits, the NADPH cofactor and CoA substrate are aligned with each other, suggesting that this is the catalytically competent state. The open-form subunits bind the cofactor and the substrate adenine rings, but the rest of the acyl-CoA substrate remains flexible and invisible in the active site. Thus, the open-subunit active sites represent a catalytically incompetent state that is preorganized for a subsequent round of catalysis. Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzyme operates with “half-site reactivity”. (16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g). The “half-site reactivity” is also consistent with a negative, rather than positive, cooperativity, as almost all our kinetics data indicate.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand if the conventional half-site reactivity theory can be applied to the ECR tetramer case, we created a model for the enzyme kinetics assuming positive or negative cooperativity between the pairs of dimers. Instead of treating the four subunits as independent entities, we hypothesized that the two pairs of ECR dimers would cycle through the CO2-fixing reactions in synchrony: i.e., when one dimer switches from the open–close to the closed–open states, the other dimer would do the opposite, closed–open to open–closed states. Using this model, we simulated the case with just one dimer with two subunits working in negative or positive cooperativity using the method described by Hill and Levitski (21) (Figure S12).[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
