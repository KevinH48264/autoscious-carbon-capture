      "In order to overcome the climate crisis, two measures are required: The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and removal of CO2 from the earth atmosphere. The latter is the goal of Tobias Erb's research group at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg. Their approaches not only aim to benefit climate protection, but also to secure sustainability in the long term: to filter CO2 from the air and make it usable for technology.\n",

      "Filtering CO2 efficiently from the air - nature can do this through photosynthesis, converting CO2 into biomass. Unlike industrial technologies which can only use the gas in a highly concentrated form (which in turn consumes fossil energy), photosynthesis works directly with ambient air containing only 0.4% gaseous carbon dioxide. Its secret lies in the enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts to mediate specific chemical reactions, such as the fixation of CO2. In photosynthesis, this reaction is driven by the enzyme RubisCO. However, the efficiency of natural photosynthesis is not very high: in more than a fourth of all cases, RubisCO metabolizes oxygen from the air, which is a strong competitor of CO2 in this reaction.ECR enzymes are faster and more precise than RubisCoTherefore, the Max Planck researchers in Marburg have decided on alternatives to RubisCO. Enoyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase enzymes (ECRs) are much more efficient than RubisCO and do not make mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase. Using a combined approach of structural biology, biochemistry and computer simulations, they were able to understand for the first time how the enzyme binds and converts CO2.Teamwork in the active centre\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

      "Text: In order to overcome the climate crisis, two measures are required: The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and removal of CO2 from the earth atmosphere. The latter is the goal of Tobias Erb's research group at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg. Their approaches not only aim to benefit climate protection, but also to secure sustainability in the long term: to filter CO2 from the air and make it usable for technology.\n",

      "Filtering CO2 efficiently from the air - nature can do this through photosynthesis, converting CO2 into biomass. Unlike industrial technologies which can only use the gas in a highly concentrated form (which in turn consumes fossil energy), photosynthesis works directly with ambient air containing only 0.4% gaseous carbon dioxide. Its secret lies in the enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts to mediate specific chemical reactions, such as the fixation of CO2. In photosynthesis, this reaction is driven by the enzyme RubisCO. However, the efficiency of natural photosynthesis is not very high: in more than a fourth of all cases, RubisCO metabolizes oxygen from the air, which is a strong competitor of CO2 in this reaction.ECR enzymes are faster and more precise than RubisCoTherefore, the Max Planck researchers in Marburg have decided on alternatives to RubisCO. Enoyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase enzymes (ECRs) are much more efficient than RubisCO and do not make mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase. Using a combined approach of structural biology, biochemistry and computer simulations, they were able to understand for the first time how the enzyme binds and converts CO2.Teamwork in the active centre\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary catalytic activity of ECRs on the level of the protein assembly remain elusive. Here we used a combination of ambient-temperature X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) and cryogenic synchrotron experiments to study the structural organization of the ECR from Kitasatospora setae. The K. setae ECR is a homotetramer that differentiates into a pair of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits in the catalytically active state. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based mutagenesis, we show that catalysis is synchronized in the K. setae ECR across the pair of dimers. This conformational coupling of catalytic domains is conferred by individual amino acids to achieve high CO2-fixation rates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into the dynamic organization and synchronized inter- and intrasubunit communications of this remarkably efficient CO2-fixing enzyme during catalysis.SynopsisIntersubunit coupling drives fast carboxylation by enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases, providing the basis for engineering highly efficient CO2-fixing enzymes for bioenergy and bioproduct applications.IntroductionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferencesThe capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2 remains a challenging task for chemistry, resulting in an ever-increasing interest to understand and exploit CO2 fixation mechanisms offered by biology. Nature has evolved different enzymes capable of capturing and/or converting CO2, including biotin-dependent CoA carboxylases, which incorporate CO2 into different alkyl-CoA esters, formate dehydrogenases, which directly reduce CO2 into the single-carbon compound formate, and RubisCO, the central enzyme in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle of photosynthesis that produces two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate from ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and CO2. (1−4) The recently discovered family of enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (ECRs) encompasses some of the most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes found in nature to date. (1) With respect to the catalytic rate, for instance, ECR family members from primary metabolism outcompete RubisCO by more than 1 order of magnitude, which makes them exquisite models to study the molecular basis of efficient CO2 catalysis. (2,5)ECRs catalyze the reduction of various α,β-unsaturated enoyl-CoAs into the corresponding alkylmalonyl-CoA esters using the reduced form of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Hydride transfer from NADPH to the substrate generates a reactive enolate species, which acts as a nucleophile that attacks a bound CO2 molecule (Figure 1a). (2,5−7) However, the structural details of the carboxylation reaction have remained elusive, in part due to the lack of high-resolution structures of ECRs containing catalytic intermediates and carboxylated products.Figure 1Figure 1.

These ECRs all have different substrate specificities, ranging from short (PDB: 3HZZ, 3KRT)- to long-chain (4A0S (8)) and aromatic enoyl-CoA substrates (4Y0K (9)), and are from different biological backgrounds, including primary (i.e., central carbon) metabolism (PDB: 4GI2) and secondary metabolism (PDB: 4A0S, 4Y0K). However, most of them cocrystallized with only NADPH or NADP+ and do not contain CO2, enoyl-CoA substrates, or acyl-CoA products.In a recent study, we reported the ternary structure of the ECR (EC 1.3.1.85) from K. setae in a complex with ethylmalonyl-CoA and NADPH (PDB: 6OWE) and identified four active site residues critical to binding and accommodation of CO2 at the monomer level. (10) Yet, the molecular mechanism of the extraordinary rate enhancement of CO2 fixation by ECR tetramers remains enigmatic. This is even more notable, as ECR complexes from primary metabolism, such as the K. setae ECR, show on average almost 30-fold higher CO2 fixation rates in comparison to those ECR complexes from secondary metabolism, despite having very high structural similarities. Overall, this work indicated that ECRs from primary metabolism must use specific mechanisms that allow them to enhance CO2 fixation dramatically in comparison to their structurally closely related homologues from secondary metabolism.Here, we aimed at providing a mechanistic understanding of the fast carboxylation reaction of the K. setae ECR on the level of the overall oligomeric complex. We first determined four high-resolution K. setae ECR structures in different conformational states: the apo form and three holo forms in a binary complex with the reduced cofactor NADPH, in a ternary complex with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, and a binary complex with the oxidized cofactor NADP+ (Figure 1b).Our high-resolution structures show that the tetrameric complex assumes a pair of dimers geometry. In this complex, the central oligomerization domains of the K. setae ECR remain essentially unchanged, while the peripheral catalytic domains move significantly to provide two sets of active site conformations─open and closed forms─upon binding of the NADPH cofactors in the presence of substrates. This coordinated motion is enabled by a tight coupling of catalytic domains across the pairs of dimers, which we could trace to the role of individual amino acids far away from the active site. Using computer simulations and kinetic experiments, we provide compelling evidence that synchronization across the pair of dimers through “swing and twist motions” is crucial for the K. setae ECR to achieve high catalytic rates. We further demonstrate that subunit communication within a dimer is essential to synchronize open and closed states. Altogether, our results unveil a dynamic intersubunit synchronization of the K. setae ECR complex that is essential for the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes during catalysis.Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferences Apo ECR Is a Symmetric Homotetramer, Readily Accessible for Cofactor and Substrate BindingWe first determined the apo form of the ECR crystal structure from K. setae at 1.8 Å resolution using synchrotron X-ray crystallography at cryogenic temperature (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

      "Text: B). The catalytic domains of the K. setae ECR are located at the periphery of the tetrameric complex. The active site cavities in the apo form are open and accessible for both cofactors and substrates. We also determined the structure of NADP+-bound ECR at cryogenic temperature and found that it is rather similar to that of the apo form structure, although NADP+ molecules are bound in all four subunits. We postulate that the same crystallization conditions used for both structures might have resulted in the same space group (P212121) with similar crystal contacts, which might have kept the NADP+ bound ECR tetramer in the apo form. The NADP+-bound subunits are less rigid in comparison, and some residues show greater variations (Figures S1 and S2). Cofactor Binding Breaks Tetramer Symmetry and Induces Formation of a Pair of DimersIn order to understand the effects of binding of NADPH, a cofactor before reaction as opposed to the spent cofactor NADP+ described above, we then determined the K. setae ECR-NADPH binary complex’s crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) at ambient temperature (Figure 2 and Table S1). (12−15) In all four subunits, NADPH binds with its adenine moiety in the oligomerization domain and spans the catalytic domain, where its nicotinamide moiety is located (Figure S5).Figure 2Figure 2. Binding of NADPH results in global and local conformational changes in K. setae ECR.

(b) The foreground dimer with open (orange)- and closed-form (green) subunits rotated by 30° from the view in (a). Each subunit is composed of a catalytic and an oligomerization domain. (c) Comparison of the putative substrate binding sites between the open- and closed-form subunits.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideNotably, NADPH binding breaks the dihedral D2 symmetry observed in the apo-form tetramer, while symmetry about the y axis is retained, resulting in a noncrystallographic, almost cyclic C2 symmetry (Figure S1). In the NADPH*ECR binary complex, each of the two dimers, A/C and B/D, loses its 2-fold symmetry, giving rise to closed (A and B) and open (C and D) subunits (Figure 2a,b and Figure S1). In the A and B subunits, the cofactor binding pocket is compressed inward, which seals the NADPH cofactor within the catalytic domain, resulting in a “closed-form” state (Figure 2b). On the other hand, the C and D subunits show open cofactor-binding pockets, referred to hereafter as an “open-form” state. The substrate-binding pocket in the open-form C or D subunit is more than 5 Å wider than the closed A or B subunit (Figure 2c). When they were taken together, these structures indicated that during catalysis the enzyme differentiates into a pair of dimers (A/C and B/D dimers, respectively), with one closed (A or B) and one open subunit (C or D) per dimer. Cofactor–Substrate Complex Indicates Half-Site Reactivity within Each DimerWe next investigated the effects of substrate binding to the K. setae ECR tetramer complex and determined its ternary complex structure with the substrate analogue butyryl-CoA and NADPH at 1.7 Å resolution (Figure 3). The structure is overall very similar to the conformation of the ECR*NADPH binary complex with the noncrystallographic, pseudo-C2 cyclic symmetry (Figure 3a and Figure S1). It comprises two sets of open- and closed-form subunits that overlay very well with those of the ECR*NADPH binary complex (Figures S1 and S2). The NADPH cofactor appears to be bound to all active sites; however, only the closed-form subunits A and B also contain electron density for the complete butyryl-CoA thioester, while the open-form subunits (C and D) show only the adenine group electron density of the butyryl-CoA thioester (Figure 3a,b). The presence of the intact butyryl-CoA thioester in the active site of the closed-form subunits strongly suggests that the A and B conformations represent the Michaelis complex in which the substrate and cofactor are positioned for catalysis. In contrast, the open-form subunits (C and D) represent catalytically incompetent ternary complexes.Figure 3Figure 3. Structure of the ternary ECR complex.

Notably, the CoA-thioester extends from the closed-form active site out to the oligomerization domain of the neighboring open-form subunit in the same dimer pair (from A to C in the A/C dimer, or from B to D in the B/D dimer), where R352 and Y353 from the open-form subunit (C or D) interact with the phosphate backbone of the CoA. The adenosine tail of the CoA extending from the closed-form subunit interacts with the three residues Y328, K296, and R303 that form an adenine binding pocket at the neighboring open-form subunit (Figure 3g). When we inspected CoA-thioester binding in the open-form subunits, we also observed the electron density in the adenine binding pocket of the neighboring closed form subunits (A or B), strongly indicating that the CoA-thioester was bound (Figure 3g, right inset). However, the electron density beyond the adenine ring becomes invisible, suggesting that the part of the CoA molecule reaching into the open-form subunit’s active site remains flexible and disordered, which is corroborated by the higher B-factors of the catalytic domain (Figure 1, bottom right).To evaluate the substrate’s flexibility in the open- and closed-form subunits, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations on a dimer of subunits A and C that account for the electronic degrees of freedom of the substrate were combined with MM simulations of the pair of dimers (tetramer) with substrates initially modeled in the open and bound closed subunits to reach longer time scales. These simulations showed that the substrate in the closed subunit had significantly lower temperature factors (B-factors) in comparison to that in the open subunit (Figures S6–S8 and Movies S1a–e and S2a–e). In the open subunit, the acyl moiety shows a high degree of flexibility in the active site, in agreement with the higher B-factors observed in crystal structures.Together, crystallographic structures and QM/MM simulations indicate that upon substrate binding the enzyme complex splits into two catalytically competent (A or B) and incompetent subunits (C or D) per dimer, suggesting that the enzyme tetramer operates with half-site reactivity, in which catalytically competent and incompetent active sites alternate during catalysis.

In our simulations, the closed subunit remained closed and maintained crotonyl-CoA in the active site when the dynamics of the substrate were restrained to maintain specific protein–substrate/cofactor interactions. However, in simulations without substrate restraints, the acyl moiety of the substrate left the active site, resulting in a conformational change of the closed subunit to the open form.To study this conformational change in detail, we eliminated the crotonyl-CoA substrate from the ternary complex, creating an ECR*NADPH binary complex with two closed and two open subunits.

      "Text:  the first tens of nanoseconds (the same was observed when we started from the X-ray binary ECR*NADPH structure). To further describe this conformational change, we used principal component analysis (PCA) of the backbone Cα atom’s positions of 10 combined 100 ns trajectories of both dimers. The 100 ns time scale was enough to describe the primary steps of the conformational changes, as evidenced by the convergence analysis (Figures S9 and S10). The first principal component (PC1) represents a transition of the closed to the open form, and the second principal component (PC2) describes a twist motion of one subunit to the other subunit in each dimer. In both cases the catalytic domains move relative to the oligomerization domains (Figure 4a–c and Movies S3 and S4). The rotation axes of PC1 and PC2 cross with each other with close to 90° inside the catalytic domain in each subunit. The two PC1 axes of subunits A and C are nearly parallel, corresponding to the closed-open motions, while the PC2 axes show the twisting motions of the catalytic domains (Figure 4b,c).Figure 4Figure 4. Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analyses reveal that the absence of the substrate induces a transition between the open and closed forms of the catalytic domain in the ECR tetramer and a twist in the subunits, which would move a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor. (a) Representation of the swing motion of the catalytic domain in dimer AC described by the first principal component (PC1) and the twist motion of one subunit to the other by PC2. This twist motion would bring a bound substrate closer to the NADPH cofactor. PC1 and PC2 axes of A (closed) and C (open) subunits are superimposed on the ternary tetramer structure in the same orientation as in Figure 3a, showing the functional relevance of PC1 as opening–closing and PC2 as twisting of the catalytic domains. (b, c) Sets of vectors between initial and final Cα positions of the catalytic domains are shown viewed along the PC1 (b) and PC2 (c) axes of subunit A as shown on the bottom left of (a).

Time traces of PC1 are shown on the left and those of PC2 on the right. In the middle, free energy profiles as a function of PC1 and PC2 were derived for the wild type (orange) and variant (blue) on the basis of the observed kinetics. The triple variant with slower opening kinetics (PC1) is consistent with a barrier in the transition to the open form, and its larger standard deviation suggests a shallower minimum in the closed form. The free energy profile of PC2 corresponds to a broad minimum for the triple variant because of the larger standard deviation observed in the kinetics and a large barrier to reach the twisted conformation observed in the WT dynamics (brown trajectory shown in dimer AC for PC2 on the right).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideTo characterize the dynamics, we compared the projections of all 10 dimer trajectories on PC1 and PC2. Dimer A/C opens its closed subunit first, associated with PC1, followed by a twist motion characterized by PC2 in some of the simulations (Figure 4d and Figure S10). This twist motion rotates the catalytic domain of the empty, now open form active site in subunit A, which would push a bound crotonyl-CoA substrate toward the NADPH cofactor in the C subunit. The B/D dimer’s dynamics, on the other hand, were mainly governed by the closed subunit opening represented by PC1, likely because of the initial structural differences of the two dimers.After characterizing the conformational transitions associated with the presence or absence of CoA substrate, we asked whether the dynamics of one dimer in the tetramer complex is coupled to that of the other dimer. Computer simulations allowed us to address this question by studying the dynamics of a hypothetical system that lacks the substrate in only one active site.

      "Text: ed subunit B still bearing the substrate remains closed, if the two dynamics of the pair of dimers are uncoupled. The projection of 10 100 ns trajectories on PC1 and PC2 confirmed that the empty active site (A in the A/C dimer) undergoes a conformational change to the open form (Figure 4d), whereas the dimer containing the substrate (B in the B/D dimer) remained in a closed conformation (see Figure S11 for a comparison to the simulation with two substrates maintaining the closed state). Importantly, however, none of the A/C dimer trajectories showed a significant change in PC2 associated with the twist motion observed in the binary ECR*NADPH complex, indicating that the twist motion is only initiated once the other dimer B/D adopts the open conformation.In summary, our molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the absence or release of the substrate triggers a conformational transition from the closed to the open conformation and that coupled dynamics of the two dimer pairs induce an additional twist motion after opening the closed subunit of the other dimer pair.

The intercatalytic domain interface is predominantly hydrophobic with some electrostatic interactions (Figure 5b).

A multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W (20) showed that E151, N218, and N157 are highly conserved in ECRs from primary (i.e., central carbon) metabolism with faster CO2-fixation kinetics (average kcat 28 s–1), but not in ECRs from secondary metabolism with an average kcat of 1.2 s–1 (Figure 5c), which raised the question about their potential role in promoting catalysis in primary metabolic ECRs.Notably, mutation of these residues that are more than 20 Å away from the active site dramatically affected the kinetic parameters of K. setae ECR (Table 1). In the E151D variant, the kcat value decreased by a factor of 5, demonstrating that weakening the interaction between catalytic domains has profound effects on the enzyme’s catalytic rate. Mutations that targeted the asparagine interaction network also showed substantial effects on the catalytic rate and affected the KM value of substrate binding.

Gel filtration under the same conditions as for our kinetic measurements showed that all enzyme variants remained tetramers, while a native gel analysis conducted under more disruptive conditions showed slight increases in the dimer and monomer fractions. Overall, our mutational and kinetic data supported the hypothesis that synchronization of catalytic domains contributes to the catalytic rate and is conferred through the hydrogen-bond network at the pair of dimers interfaces.To study the effect of the E151D/N157E/N218E mutations on the synchronization of catalytic domains and the conformational transitions of the binary NADPH*ECR complex, we used computer simulations as discussed above. The projection of 10 100 ns trajectories on the previously defined eigenvectors displayed the same opening transition of both dimers in the initially closed binary NADPH*ECR triple variant complex (Figure 4d). We analyzed the time traces of their first two principal components (mean ± 1 std) of both dimers in the tetramer to spot the differences between the WT enzyme and the triple variant (see Figure 4e). Notably, the triple variant opens the closed form more slowly than the WT enzyme and presents a broader distribution of values in both dimers during transition. The observed kinetics are consistent with a free energy profile along PC1, according to which the variant must cross a higher free energy barrier to reach the open form (scheme in Figure 4e). The broader distribution during the transition is caused by a shallower energy minimum of the closed form of the triple variant. For PC2, the dynamics for the WT and the triple variant also differ. The triple variant presents a broader distribution associated with a shallow free energy minimum and shifted minima, causing the two systems to evolve in opposing directions at the beginning of the simulation. Interestingly, only the WT can pass the free energy barrier to a twisted state in some of the trajectories (shown in brown in Figure 4e). Overall, these results confirm that the E151D/N157E/N218E mutation at the dimer interfaces changes the free energy landscape of conformational transitions considerably. The communication between the dimers is reduced, as the triple variant does not share the WT’s concerted dynamics that are characterized first by an opening motion and then a twist of one subunit to the other. This twist motion of the open subunit will push the bound substrate to the NADPH cofactor and might be directly coupled to the first step of the ECR reaction: i.e., the hydride transfer.In summary, computer simulations and kinetic data of the triple variant indicate that coupling the dynamics of the two dimers is conferred by three conserved amino acids in ECRs from primary metabolism (E151, N157, and N218) and is essential to reach fast CO2 fixation kinetics in comparison to their counterparts from secondary metabolism that lack those residues. CoA Binding Synchronizes Open and Closed Subunits within a DimerIn addition to an interdimer domain interaction, the two subunits in each dimer bind different parts of the substrate in the open and closed forms through the adenine binding pocket and the active site (intradimer interaction, Figure 5a). We hypothesized that this shared substrate binding between neighboring subunits could also contribute to the mechanism of fast, synchronized catalysis.To understand the role of substrate adenine binding in catalysis, we characterized the kinetics of different single, double, and triple variants of the adenine binding site (Figure 3g and Table 2). Mutations in the adenine binding pocket, particularly of R303, strongly increased the apparent KM value of the CoA substrate as expected and decreased the enzyme’s apparent kcat value by a factor of 2–3. Notably, when we used crotonyl-panthetheine, a truncated substrate lacking the adenosine moiety, a comparable decrease in kcat value was also observed for the WT enzyme, suggesting that substrate interactions at the adenine binding pocket indeed contribute to catalysis. However, when we compared the kinetics of the WT enzyme with a truncated substrate to that of triple variant K296A/R303A/Y328F, in which adenosine binding was completely disturbed, the two variants behaved almost identically, strongly supporting the argument that binding of the adenine residue of the CoA substrate in the WT is important for high catalytic activity.Table 2.

Gel filtration under the same conditions as for our kinetic measurements showed that all enzyme variants remained tetramers, while a native gel analysis conducted under more disruptive conditions showed slight increases in the dimer and monomer fractions. Overall, our mutational and kinetic data supported the hypothesis that synchronization of catalytic domains contributes to the catalytic rate and is conferred through the hydrogen-bond network at the pair of dimers interfaces.To study the effect of the E151D/N157E/N218E mutations on the synchronization of catalytic domains and the conformational transitions of the binary NADPH*ECR complex, we used computer simulations as discussed above. The projection of 10 100 ns trajectories on the previously defined eigenvectors displayed the same opening transition of both dimers in the initially closed binary NADPH*ECR triple variant complex (Figure 4d). We analyzed the time traces of their first two principal components (mean ± 1 std) of both dimers in the tetramer to spot the differences between the WT enzyme and the triple variant (see Figure 4e). Notably, the triple variant opens the closed form more slowly than the WT enzyme and presents a broader distribution of values in both dimers during transition. The observed kinetics are consistent with a free energy profile along PC1, according to which the variant must cross a higher free energy barrier to reach the open form (scheme in Figure 4e). The broader distribution during the transition is caused by a shallower energy minimum of the closed form of the triple variant. For PC2, the dynamics for the WT and the triple variant also differ. The triple variant presents a broader distribution associated with a shallow free energy minimum and shifted minima, causing the two systems to evolve in opposing directions at the beginning of the simulation. Interestingly, only the WT can pass the free energy barrier to a twisted state in some of the trajectories (shown in brown in Figure 4e). Overall, these results confirm that the E151D/N157E/N218E mutation at the dimer interfaces changes the free energy landscape of conformational transitions considerably. The communication between the dimers is reduced, as the triple variant does not share the WT’s concerted dynamics that are characterized first by an opening motion and then a twist of one subunit to the other. This twist motion of the open subunit will push the bound substrate to the NADPH cofactor and might be directly coupled to the first step of the ECR reaction: i.e., the hydride transfer.In summary, computer simulations and kinetic data of the triple variant indicate that coupling the dynamics of the two dimers is conferred by three conserved amino acids in ECRs from primary metabolism (E151, N157, and N218) and is essential to reach fast CO2 fixation kinetics in comparison to their counterparts from secondary metabolism that lack those residues. CoA Binding Synchronizes Open and Closed Subunits within a DimerIn addition to an interdimer domain interaction, the two subunits in each dimer bind different parts of the substrate in the open and closed forms through the adenine binding pocket and the active site (intradimer interaction, Figure 5a). We hypothesized that this shared substrate binding between neighboring subunits could also contribute to the mechanism of fast, synchronized catalysis.To understand the role of substrate adenine binding in catalysis, we characterized the kinetics of different single, double, and triple variants of the adenine binding site (Figure 3g and Table 2). Mutations in the adenine binding pocket, particularly of R303, strongly increased the apparent KM value of the CoA substrate as expected and decreased the enzyme’s apparent kcat value by a factor of 2–3. Notably, when we used crotonyl-panthetheine, a truncated substrate lacking the adenosine moiety, a comparable decrease in kcat value was also observed for the WT enzyme, suggesting that substrate interactions at the adenine binding pocket indeed contribute to catalysis. However, when we compared the kinetics of the WT enzyme with a truncated substrate to that of triple variant K296A/R303A/Y328F, in which adenosine binding was completely disturbed, the two variants behaved almost identically, strongly supporting the argument that binding of the adenine residue of the CoA substrate in the WT is important for high catalytic activity.Table 2.

K332 from the open-form subunit engages in a hydrogen-bonding network with the nicotinamide of the NADPH cofactor bound to the closed-form subunit through Q165 and H365 of the neighboring subunit (Figure 5d). These interactions are not observed in the active site of the open-form subunit (Figure 5d), raising the question of whether the hydrogen-bonding network connected to the adenine binding pocket might be necessary for catalysis.In variants K332A and Q165A, kcat was decreased by 2–3-fold, and for K332A, an additional increase in the apparent KM for crotonyl-CoA was observed, indicating some effect of these residues on the catalytic rate (as well as substrate binding in case of K332) (Table 2). When we tested these variants again with the truncated substrate analogue crotonyl-pantetheine, the catalytic activity in the Q165A variant was reduced by 4-fold, while that of the K332A variant was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the WT with a truncated substrate. More notably, the KM had not changed much between the WT and the two different variants (where it has even slightly improved), strongly suggesting that Q165 and K332 are not involved in substrate accommodation but rather synchronization of catalysis between open and closed subunits within the dimer. In conclusion, adenine binding and the loop carrying the residues K332 and Q165 are necessary to synchronize catalysis between the two subunits within the dimer to drive fast CO2 fixation in the K. setae ECR, providing the molecular basis of how catalysis might be synchronized between the open- and closed-form subunits within one dimer. Half-Site Reactivity with Almost Fullly Occupied Active Sites Drives Fast CO2 FixationOur structural studies of the K. setae ECR revealed unprecedented details on the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient and fastest CO2-fixing enzymes. During catalysis, the enzyme complex differentiates into distinct functional subunits. The binding of the NADPH cofactor and substrates forces the homotetrameric apo enzyme into a pair of dimers. Each dimer is constituted of open- and closed-form subunits. In the closed-form subunits, the NADPH cofactor and CoA substrate are aligned with each other, suggesting that this is the catalytically competent state. The open-form subunits bind the cofactor and the substrate adenine rings, but the rest of the acyl-CoA substrate remains flexible and invisible in the active site. Thus, the open-subunit active sites represent a catalytically incompetent state that is preorganized for a subsequent round of catalysis. Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzyme operates with “half-site reactivity”. (16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g). The “half-site reactivity” is also consistent with a negative, rather than positive, cooperativity, as almost all our kinetics data indicate.To understand if the conventional half-site reactivity theory can be applied to the ECR tetramer case, we created a model for the enzyme kinetics assuming positive or negative cooperativity between the pairs of dimers. Instead of treating the four subunits as independent entities, we hypothesized that the two pairs of ECR dimers would cycle through the CO2-fixing reactions in synchrony: i.e., when one dimer switches from the open–close to the closed–open states, the other dimer would do the opposite, closed–open to open–closed states. Using this model, we simulated the case with just one dimer with two subunits working in negative or positive cooperativity using the method described by Hill and Levitski (21) (Figure S12).

      "Text: verall reaction rate of the K. setae ECR, we incorporated all the parameters in Hill and Levitski’s model in our simulation. It turned out that only negative cooperativity could explain our experimental observations that ECR activity in the WT tetramer is increased by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the triple variant E151D/N157E/N218E, in which synchronization is decoupled (Table 1). Our simulations yielded a 90% probability that both active sites are occupied with substrates/products and NADPH/NADP+ (p22), while only 10% are half-occupied (p12 + p21) (Figure S12). Almost none of the dimers are empty (p11), which agrees with the occupancy of our experimentally determined structures of the ternary complex.To synchronize half-site reactivity, the interaction of the catalytic domains across and within the pairs of dimers is crucial. When the latter is perturbed in the K. setae ECR (e.g., through triple mutant E151D/N157E/N218E or by disturbance of the adenosine binding pocket), the catalytic rate of the enzyme is severely diminished. This observation is consistent with other theoretical and experimental data on half-site reactivity. The synchronization of distant catalytic subunits has been calculated to enhance the catalytic rate of enzymes by up to 20-fold. (21,22) Mutation of a single amino acid that couples the two catalytic sites of heptose isomerase GmhA reduced the catalytic rate to 6% of wild-type activity. (23) Perturbing the interaction network in Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase, another example of an enzyme with half-site reactivity, (24) caused a 400-fold decrease in kcat, (25,26) demonstrating that domain interactions are essential in promoting enzyme catalysis. (27)While our structural, biochemical, and simulation data indicate that the K. setae ECR achieves high catalytic rates by synchronizing active sites, this might not necessarily be true for other ECRs. A differentiation into a pair of dimers was not observed in NADPH-bound or ternary structures of other ECRs (e.g., PDB 4Y0K and 4A0S, respectively, which share substantial amino acid identity) (Figure S13). Note, however, that ECRs fall into two different classes: primary ECRs (such as the K. setae ECR) that operate in central carbon metabolism and secondary ECRs (such as 4Y0K) that provide extender units for synthesizing polyketides in secondary metabolism. Whereas primary ECRs are under intense evolutionary pressure and show on average kcat values of 28 s–1, (28) secondary ECRs are not selected for high catalytic rates, which is also reflected by a 1 order of magnitude smaller average kcat value (kcat = 1.2 s–1). (28) Thus, it might be tempting to speculate that secondary ECRs are not selected for high turnover rates during catalysis and, therefore, might not exhibit synchronized half-site reactivity, which is further supported by the observation that the residues E151, N218, and N157, conferring synchronization at the complex interface, are not conserved in secondary ECRs (Figure 5c).ConclusionsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsMethodsSupporting InformationAuthor InformationAcknowledgmentsNote Added After ASAP PublicationReferencesAltogether, our work revealed the structural-dynamics determinants explaining the substantial rate enhancement achieved by enoyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase through coordinated catalytic domain motions in comparison to unsynchronized catalytic reactions (e.g., in the four monomers of the triple variant E151D/N157E/N218E).

Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analyses reveal that the absence of the substrate induces a transition between the open and closed forms of the catalytic domain in the ECR tetramer and a twist in the subunits, which would move a bound substrate toward the NADPH cofactor. (a) Representation of the swing motion of the catalytic domain in dimer AC described by the first principal component (PC1) and the twist motion of one subunit to the other by PC2. This twist motion would bring a bound substrate closer to the NADPH cofactor. PC1 and PC2 axes of A (closed) and C (open) subunits are superimposed on the ternary tetramer structure in the same orientation as in Figure 3a, showing the functional relevance of PC1 as opening–closing and PC2 as twisting of the catalytic domains.

Time traces of PC1 are shown on the left and those of PC2 on the right. In the middle, free energy profiles as a function of PC1 and PC2 were derived for the wild type (orange) and variant (blue) on the basis of the observed kinetics. The triple variant with slower opening kinetics (PC1) is consistent with a barrier in the transition to the open form, and its larger standard deviation suggests a shallower minimum in the closed form. The free energy profile of PC2 corresponds to a broad minimum for the triple variant because of the larger standard deviation observed in the kinetics and a large barrier to reach the twisted conformation observed in the WT dynamics (brown trajectory shown in dimer AC for PC2 on the right).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideFigure 5Figure 5.

In the closed conformation the contacts between NADPH-H365-E165 and K332 of the adjacent open subunit allow for the correct intradimer communication. In the open conformation the communication network is compromised, as indicated by the increased distances between the amino acid side chains that cause the incorrect positioning of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideReferencesARTICLE SECTIONSJump To\n",

      "Filtering CO2 efficiently from the air - nature can do this through photosynthesis, converting CO2 into biomass. Unlike industrial technologies which can only use the gas in a highly concentrated form (which in turn consumes fossil energy), photosynthesis works directly with ambient air containing only 0.4% gaseous carbon dioxide. Its secret lies in the enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts to mediate specific chemical reactions, such as the fixation of CO2. In photosynthesis, this reaction is driven by the enzyme RubisCO. However, the efficiency of natural photosynthesis is not very high: in more than a fourth of all cases, RubisCO metabolizes oxygen from the air, which is a strong competitor of CO2 in this reaction.ECR enzymes are faster and more precise than RubisCoTherefore, the Max Planck researchers in Marburg have decided on alternatives to RubisCO. Enoyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase enzymes (ECRs) are much more efficient than RubisCO and do not make mistakes with oxygen. After many years of scientific work in order to understand this capacity, the scientists have succeeded in building a functioning process in the test tube that fixes CO2 better than nature itself. Robustness and energy efficiency are the qualities that the team would like to bestow to their artificial photosynthesis. \"Learn from the best\" is the motto: nature itself serves as a model for molecular biology.What is the reason for the high efficiency of ECRs? What is the magic spell to create a turbo CO2 fixator? Max Planck junior researchers Gabriele Stoffel and Iria Bernhardsgrütter pursued this question together with colleagues from Chile and the USA. They analyzed the ECR from the bacterium Kitasatospora setae, currently the fastest known carboxylase.

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

      "\"We were surprised to learn that only four amino acids are sufficient to provide control over the CO2 molecule”, explains Gabriele Stoffel, postdoctoral fellow in the Erb department and first author of the study. “Three amino acids – one asparagine, glutamate and a histidine – hold the CO2 in place from two sides. Another amino acid, a phenylalanine, shields the bound CO2 from water, which would inhibit the reaction”, says Stoffel.These findings open up new paths for researchers.  \"We wanted to transfer the capability of binding CO2 to other enzymes. This would offer us much greater possibilities for optimizing photosynthesis,\" says Iria Bernhardsgrütter, PhD student in the research group. In another study, Bernhardsgrütter focused on two candidates for the protein scaffold: Propionyl-CoA synthase (PCS) and Archaeal Enoyl-CoA reductase (AER).Enhancing CO2 fixation capacityBoth enzymes were already able to use CO2, but only with an efficiency of about five percent and with concentrated CO2. Computational models revealed that those enzymes only possessed some of the four amino acids required and those were also misaligned. Iria Bernhardsgrütter succeeded by exchanging amino acids to correct the \"miscasts\" in PCS. Immediately, the efficiency of CO2 increased to around 20 percent. Now the second aspect was targeted, namely shielding the binding site from water. Iria Bernhardsgrütter was also able to solve this problem: another amino acid replacement blocked the water's access to the binding site. The combination of both changes led to a carboxylation rate of almost 95%. Similar experiments with AER increased CO2-conversion efficiencies to almost 90%.This knowledge of the exact requirements of CO2-fixing enzymes and its successful application has brought research a decisive step closer to its high goals: on the one hand, being able to filter CO2 efficiently from the atmosphere, on the other hand, integrating CO2 into sustainable use – towards the recycling of valuable substances following nature's example.\n",

Even though this equals only about three percent of the Earth’s surface, they play, similar to Arctic sea ice, a major role for the climate. In order to investigate ice sheets and their interaction with the climate, we are developing a climate model in which the extent of the ice sheets changes over time. Such changes and interactions have so far been insufficiently represented in conventional climate models.\n",

      "H Abe Copyright and License information DisclaimerCopyright notice AbstractThe serum creatine kinase (CK), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LD) and alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (HBD) were determined before and 3, 6, 18, and 36 hours after cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography in 56 consecutive patients with ischaemic heart disease. Five of these patients whose serum enzyme levels were higher than normal before the procedure were excluded from the study. Forty-one of the remaining 51 patients had left ventriculography and also selective coronary arteriography. In these 41 patients (groups 1 and 2--see below), the mean serum CK levels increased after the procedure to exceed the upper limit of normal at every study interval. The mean serum AST, LD, and HBD levels generally remained within the normal range at all study intervals, though serum AST increased abnormally in 9 of the 41 patients (22%) and serum LD and HBD each increased above the normal limit in 2 of 41 patients (4.9%). In 24 patients (group 1) whose coronary arteriograms showed insignificant coronary narrowing (less than 75%) in any of the three major coronary arteries, the increase in serum CK was significantly higher than in 17 patients (group 2) with greater than 75% narrowings in at least one of the three major coronary arteries. However, the degree of serum CK elevation observed during the postangiographic period was much lower than that in another group of 30 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. In 10 patients (group 3) who had the same procedure as groups 1 and 2 except without the selective coronary arteriography, the serum enzyme levels showed no noticeable increase after the procedure. The difference in postangiographic serum CK elevation between patients with and without selective coronary arteriography and the difference between group 1 (without significant coronory narrowing) and group 2 (with significant narrowing) strongly suggest that the raised serum CK levels represent some form of myocardial damage caused by the coronary arteriography, which, however, is different at least in degree from that of acute myocardial infarction.Full textFull text is available as a scanned copy of the original print version.

      "May 3, 2022Artist interpretation of the enzyme Credit: SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryResearchers discover that a spot of molecular glue and a timely twist help a bacterial enzyme convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis. The results stand to accelerate progress toward converting carbon dioxide into a variety of products.Carbon fixation, or the conversion of carbon dioxide from the air into carbon-rich biomolecules, is essential for plants’ survival. That’s the whole point of photosynthesis, and a cornerstone of the vast interlocking system that cycles carbon through plants, animals, microbes, and the atmosphere to sustain life on Earth.The carbon-fixing champs, however, are soil bacteria, not plants. Scientists may be able to develop artificial photosynthesis to convert greenhouse gas into fuels, fertilizers, antibiotics, and other products if they can figure out how certain bacterial enzymes carry out a vital step in carbon fixation 20 times quicker than plant enzymes.Now a team of researchers from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Germany, DOE’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the University of Concepción in Chile has discovered how a bacterial enzyme – a molecular machine that facilitates chemical reactions – revs up to perform this feat.Rather than grabbing carbon dioxide molecules and attaching them to biomolecules one at a time, they found that this enzyme consists of pairs of molecules that work in sync, like the hands of a juggler who simultaneously tosses and catches balls to get the job done faster. One member of each enzyme pair opens wide to catch a set of reaction ingredients while the other closes over its captured ingredients and carries out the carbon-fixing reaction; then, they switch roles in a continual cycle.A single spot of molecular “glue” holds each pair of enzymatic hands together so they can alternate opening and closing in a coordinated way, the team discovered, while a twisting motion helps hustle ingredients and finished products in and out of the pockets where the reactions take place. When both glue and twist are present, the carbon-fixing reaction goes 100 times faster than without them.This animation shows two of the paired molecules (blue and white) within the ECR enzyme, which fixes carbon in soil microbes, in action. They work together, like the hands of a juggler who simultaneously tosses and catches balls, to get the job done faster. One member of each enzyme pair opens wide to catch a set of reaction ingredients (shown coming in from top and bottom) while the other closes over its captured ingredients and carries out the carbon-fixing reaction; then, they switch roles in a continual cycle. Scientists are trying to harness and improve these reactions for artificial photosynthesis to make a variety of products. Credit: H. DeMirci et al., ACS Central Science, 2022“This bacterial enzyme is the most efficient carbon fixer that we know of, and we came up with a neat explanation of what it can do,” said Soichi Wakatsuki, a professor at SLAC and Stanford and one of the senior leaders of the study, which was published in ACS Central Science this week.“Some of the enzymes in this family act slowly but in a very specific way to produce just one product,” he said. “Others are much faster and can craft chemical building blocks for all sorts of products. Now that we know the mechanism, we can engineer enzymes that combine the best features of both approaches and do a very fast job with all sorts of starting materials.”Improving on natureThe enzyme the team studied is part of a family called enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases, or ECRs. It comes from soil bacteria called Kitasatospora setae, which in addition to their carbon-fixing skills can also produce antibiotics.Wakatsuki heard about this enzyme family half a dozen years ago from Tobias Erb of the Max P\n",

      "May 3, 2022Artist interpretation of the enzyme Credit: SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryResearchers discover that a spot of molecular glue and a timely twist help a bacterial enzyme convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis. The results stand to accelerate progress toward converting carbon dioxide into a variety of products.Carbon fixation, or the conversion of carbon dioxide from the air into carbon-rich biomolecules, is essential for plants’ survival. That’s the whole point of photosynthesis, and a cornerstone of the vast interlocking system that cycles carbon through plants, animals, microbes, and the atmosphere to sustain life on Earth.The carbon-fixing champs, however, are soil bacteria, not plants. Scientists may be able to develop artificial photosynthesis to convert greenhouse gas into fuels, fertilizers, antibiotics, and other products if they can figure out how certain bacterial enzymes carry out a vital step in carbon fixation 20 times quicker than plant enzymes.Now a team of researchers from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Germany, DOE’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the University of Concepción in Chile has discovered how a bacterial enzyme – a molecular machine that facilitates chemical reactions – revs up to perform this feat.Rather than grabbing carbon dioxide molecules and attaching them to biomolecules one at a time, they found that this enzyme consists of pairs of molecules that work in sync, like the hands of a juggler who simultaneously tosses and catches balls to get the job done faster. One member of each enzyme pair opens wide to catch a set of reaction ingredients while the other closes over its captured ingredients and carries out the carbon-fixing reaction; then, they switch roles in a continual cycle.A single spot of molecular “glue” holds each pair of enzymatic hands together so they can alternate opening and closing in a coordinated way, the team discovered, while a twisting motion helps hustle ingredients and finished products in and out of the pockets where the reactions take place. When both glue and twist are present, the carbon-fixing reaction goes 100 times faster than without them.This animation shows two of the paired molecules (blue and white) within the ECR enzyme, which fixes carbon in soil microbes, in action. They work together, like the hands of a juggler who simultaneously tosses and catches balls, to get the job done faster. One member of each enzyme pair opens wide to catch a set of reaction ingredients (shown coming in from top and bottom) while the other closes over its captured ingredients and carries out the carbon-fixing reaction; then, they switch roles in a continual cycle. Scientists are trying to harness and improve these reactions for artificial photosynthesis to make a variety of products. Credit: H. DeMirci et al., ACS Central Science, 2022“This bacterial enzyme is the most efficient carbon fixer that we know of, and we came up with a neat explanation of what it can do,” said Soichi Wakatsuki, a professor at SLAC and Stanford and one of the senior leaders of the study, which was published in ACS Central Science this week.“Some of the enzymes in this family act slowly but in a very specific way to produce just one product,” he said. “Others are much faster and can craft chemical building blocks for all sorts of products. Now that we know the mechanism, we can engineer enzymes that combine the best features of both approaches and do a very fast job with all sorts of starting materials.”Improving on natureThe enzyme the team studied is part of a family called enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases, or ECRs. It comes from soil bacteria called Kitasatospora setae, which in addition to their carbon-fixing skills can also produce antibiotics.Wakatsuki heard about this enzyme family half a dozen years ago from Tobias Erb of the Max P\n",

Erb’s research team had been working to develop bioreactors for artificial photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into all sorts of products.As important as photosynthesis is to life on Earth, Erb said, it isn’t very efficient. Like all things shaped by evolution over the eons, it’s only as good as it needs to be, the result of slowly building on previous developments but never inventing something entirely new from scratch.A close-up look at Kitasatospora setae, a bacterium isolated from soil in Japan.

Iwai, atlas.actino.jpWhat’s more, he said, the step in natural photosynthesis that fixes CO2 from the air, which relies on an enzyme called Rubisco, is a bottleneck that bogs the whole chain of photosynthetic reactions down. So using speedy ECR enzymes to carry out this step, and engineering them to go even faster, could bring a big boost in efficiency.“We aren’t trying to make a carbon copy of photosynthesis,” Erb explained. “We want to design a process that’s much more efficient by using our understanding of engineering to rebuild the concepts of nature. This ‘photosynthesis 2.0’ could take place in living or synthetic systems such as artificial chloroplasts – droplets of water suspended in oil.”Portraits of an enzymeWakatsuki and his group had been investigating a related system, nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into compounds that living things need. Intrigued by the question of why ECR enzymes were so fast, he started collaborating with Erb’s group to find answers.Hasan DeMirci, a research associate in Wakatsuki’s group who is now an assistant professor at Koc University and investigator with the Stanford PULSE Institute, led the effort at SLAC with help from half a dozen SLAC summer interns he supervised. “We train six or seven of them every year, and they were fearless,” he said. “They came with open minds, ready to learn, and they did amazing things.”The SLAC team made samples of the ECR enzyme and crystallized them for examination with X-rays at the Advanced Photon Source at DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory. The X-rays revealed the molecular structure of the enzyme – the arrangement of its atomic scaffolding – both on its own and when attached to a small helper molecule that facilitates its work.Further X-ray studies at SLAC’s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) showed how the enzyme’s structure shifted when it attached to a substrate, a kind of molecular workbench that assembles ingredients for the carbon fixing reaction and spurs the reaction along.This depiction of ECR, an enzyme found in soil bacteria, shows each of its four identical molecules in a different color. These molecules work together in pairs – blue with white and green with orange – to turn carbon dioxide from the microbe’s environment into biomolecules it needs to survive. A new study shows that a spot of molecular glue and a timely swing and twist allow these pairs to sync their motions and fix carbon 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis.

DeMirci et al., ACS Central Science, 2022Finally, a team of researchers from SLAC’s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) carried out more detailed studies of the enzyme and its substrate at Japan’s SACLA X-ray free-electron laser. The choice of an X-ray laser was important because it allowed them to study the enzyme’s behavior at room temperature – closer to its natural environment – with almost no radiation damage.Meanwhile, Erb’s group in Germany and Associate Professor Esteban Vo¨hringer-Martinez’s group at the University of Concepción in Chile carried out detailed biochemical studies and extensive dynamic simulations to make sense of the structural data collected by Wakatsuki and his team.The simulations revealed that the opening and closing of the enzyme’s two parts don’t just involve molecular glue, but also twisting motions around the central axis of each enzyme pair, Wakatsuki said.“This twist is almost like a rachet that can push a finished product out or pull a new set of ingredients into the pocket where the reaction takes place,” he said. Together, the twisting and synchronization of the enzyme pairs allow them to fix carbon 100 times a second.The ECR enzyme family also includes a more versatile branch that can interact with many different kinds of biomolecules to produce a variety of products.

      "Text:  the rate of those sophisticated reactions to make new biomolecules,” Wakatsuki said, “that would be a significant jump in the field.”From static shots to fluid moviesSo far the experiments have produced static snapshots of the enzyme, the reaction ingredients and the final products in various configurations.“Our dream experiment,” Wakatsuki said, “would be to combine all the ingredients as they flow into the path of the X-ray laser beam so we could watch the reaction take place in real time.”The team actually tried that at SACLA, he said, but it didn’t work. “The CO2 molecules are really small, and they move so fast that it’s hard to catch the moment when they attach to the substrate,” he said. “Plus the X-ray laser beam is so strong that we couldn’t keep the ingredients in it long enough for the reaction to take place. When we pressed hard to do this, we managed to break the crystals.”An upcoming high-energy upgrade to LCLS will likely solve that problem, he added, with pulses that arrive much more frequently – a million times per second – and can be individually adjusted to the ideal strength for each sample.Wakatsuki said his team continues to collaborate with Erb’s group, and it’s working with the LCLS sample delivery group and with researchers at the SLAC-Stanford cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilities to find a way to make this approach work.Researchers from the RIKEN Spring-8 Center and Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute also contributed to this work, which received major funding from the DOE Office of Science. Much of the preliminary work for this study was carried out by SLAC summer intern Yash Rao; interns Brandon Hayes, E. Han Dao and Manat Kaur also made key contributions. DOE’s Joint Genome Institute provided the DNA used to produce the ECR samples.

      "Text:  the rate of those sophisticated reactions to make new biomolecules,” Wakatsuki said, “that would be a significant jump in the field.”From static shots to fluid moviesSo far the experiments have produced static snapshots of the enzyme, the reaction ingredients and the final products in various configurations.“Our dream experiment,” Wakatsuki said, “would be to combine all the ingredients as they flow into the path of the X-ray laser beam so we could watch the reaction take place in real time.”The team actually tried that at SACLA, he said, but it didn’t work. “The CO2 molecules are really small, and they move so fast that it’s hard to catch the moment when they attach to the substrate,” he said. “Plus the X-ray laser beam is so strong that we couldn’t keep the ingredients in it long enough for the reaction to take place. When we pressed hard to do this, we managed to break the crystals.”An upcoming high-energy upgrade to LCLS will likely solve that problem, he added, with pulses that arrive much more frequently – a million times per second – and can be individually adjusted to the ideal strength for each sample.Wakatsuki said his team continues to collaborate with Erb’s group, and it’s working with the LCLS sample delivery group and with researchers at the SLAC-Stanford cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilities to find a way to make this approach work.Researchers from the RIKEN Spring-8 Center and Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute also contributed to this work, which received major funding from the DOE Office of Science. Much of the preliminary work for this study was carried out by SLAC summer intern Yash Rao; interns Brandon Hayes, E. Han Dao and Manat Kaur also made key contributions. DOE’s Joint Genome Institute provided the DNA used to produce the ECR samples. SSRL, LCLS, the Advanced Photon Source and the Joint Genome Institute are all DOE Office of Science user facilities.Reference: “Intersubunit Coupling Enables Fast CO2-Fixation by Reductive Carboxylases” by Hasan DeMirci, Yashas Rao, Gabriele M.

Our findings define the atomic framework for the future development of CO2-converting catalysts in biology and chemistry.AbstractCarboxylases are biocatalysts that capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) under mild conditions and atmospheric concentrations at a scale of more than 400 Gt annually.

      "The efficient capture and conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a prerequisite to develop a carbon-neutral, circular future economy. In biology, carbon fixation is performed under mild conditions and at atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (0.04 vol.%) by enzymes called carboxylases (1). It is estimated that 400 Gt of CO2 are fixed annually by a single biocatalyst, ribulose-1,5-bisphophate-carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), the key enzyme of photosynthesis (2, 3). In comparison, the chemical conversion of CO2 in industry accounts for only 0.1 Gt of carbon annually and uses pressurized CO2 (4), which emphasizes our need to understand the molecular mechanism that allows (bio)catalysts to selectively interact with a low-concentrated CO2 molecule during catalysis.Carboxylases catalyze the formation of a C–C bond between an acceptor substrate and a CO2 molecule (1) where the latter represents the electrophile (5). To facilitate C–C bond formation, most carboxylases activate their respective nucleophilic substrate (usually a thioester, α-ketoacid, or ketone) by converting it into an enol(ate) (6). Enol(ate)s are strong nucleophiles and highly reactive. A key requirement of CO2-fixation catalysis is the tight control of the reaction between the activated acceptor substrate and CO2. Any loss of catalytic control over the enol(ate) or the CO2 molecule bears the danger of side reactions and reduces the efficiency of carbon fixation (7). The most prominent example is RuBisCO, which is known to feature several side reactions, most notably an oxygenation reaction (8). One in every 5 turnovers RuBisCO will incorporate an oxygen (O2) molecule instead of CO2, which leads to the formation of 2-phosphoglycolate, a side product that is toxic to the cell and has to be recycled in an energy-demanding process, highlighting the need of carboxylases to control the reaction of the activated acceptor with CO2.Another challenge in this respect is the accessibility of water (or protic amino acids) to the active site of carboxylases. Protons are better electrophiles than the CO2 molecule, which can directly quench the enolate. As a consequence, it is not sufficient that carboxylases enrich a low abundant gaseous CO2 molecule; they also need to efficiently suppress any competing (re)protonation reactions. Altogether, these examples show that controlling the fate of CO2 at the molecular level is a crucial feature of carboxylases. However, to date only very limited biochemical, let alone structural, information on CO2 binding in carboxylases (and other proteins) is available, besides some theoretical considerations (9–14).Here, we focused on a class of carboxylases, enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases (Ecrs) (15, 16) that show the fastest turnover frequencies among all carboxylases to date and exclusively react with CO2 in the presence of O2. These features make Ecrs excellent model systems to understand the details of selective CO2 binding and C–C-bond formation in proteins.The best-studied Ecr is crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (Ccr) that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of crotonyl-CoA into (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA.

      "Text: eactivity with O2, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA as a side reaction, but only in the absence of CO2 and at low catalytic efficiency (Scheme 1) (17, 18). It has been suggested that this side reaction is an evolutionary remnant of Ecrs, which are evolutionary related to enoyl thioester reductases that catalyze the ordinary reduction of enoyl-CoA esters (6, 19). Apparently, Ecrs evolved from simple reductases into reductive carboxylases by acquiring a CO2-fixation function along their evolutionary trajectory.Scheme 1.Reaction catalyzed by Ccr. Carboxylation to (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA in the presence of CO2 and reduction to butyryl-CoA in the absence of CO2.Open in viewerIn a previous structural study, CinF, an Ecr from Streptomyces sp. JS360, was crystallized with NADP+ and octenoyl-CoA [Protein Data Bank (PDB); PDB ID code: 4A0S (20)]. A putative CO2 binding pocket was proposed to be composed of Asn77, Phe166, and Glu167, which are all highly conserved in Ecrs. It was suggested that CO2 is held in position by hydrogen bonding to Asn77 and Glu167 while Phe166 would undergo hydrophobic interactions with CO2. Mutation of these residues suppressed the carboxylation of octenoyl-CoA (20). However, the exact role of the individual residues directing and controlling the carboxylation reaction remains enigmatic: in particular, how the gaseous CO2 molecule is aligned at the active site and how the reduction side reaction is efficiently suppressed.Here we combine experimental biochemistry, protein crystallography, and computer simulations to define the molecular interactions of CO2 during C–C-bond formation at the active site of Ecrs. Our results suggest that 4 amino acids are sufficient to convert an ordinary reductase into a highly efficient carboxylase. Together, these 4 residues anchor and lock the CO2 molecule in a favorable position for the attack by the reactive enolate created during catalysis. Notably, a highly ordered water molecule plays an essential role in coordinating the CO2 molecule, while the active site is otherwise effectively shielded from water to suppress the reduction side reaction. Altogether our computational and experimental studies reveal the details of selective CO2 binding and C–C-bond formation in the catalytic cycle of nature’s most efficient CO2-fixing enzyme.ResultsCrystal Structure of KsCcr with Ethylmalonyl-CoA and NADPH.We solved the structure of Ccr from Kitasatospora setae (KsCcr) cocrystallized with NADPH and soaked with ethylmalonyl-CoA, the product of the carboxylation reaction, at 1.7-Å resolution (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1, PDB ID code: 6OWE). The active site of KsCcr shares similar features with the CinF homolog previously reported (20) [PDB ID codes: 4A0S (20), 4Y0K (21), and 4GI2]. In contrast to these structures that did not capture the interaction of the protein with CO2, neither as free gas or covalently bound to the acyl-CoA moiety, our structure shows densities that can be interpreted as carboxylated product (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This enabled us to identify 4 residues that potentially interact with CO2, namely Asn81, Phe170, Glu171, and His365. His365 also interacts with NADPH via hydrogen bonding (3.0 Å) to the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide, indicating a second function of His365 in coordinating the NADPH cofactor during catalysis. Similar to previously published structures we also observed an ordered water molecule between His365 and Glu171 at a distance of 2.9 and 2.7 Å, respectively. This feature is absent in structures lacking substrate and cofactor (PDB ID codes: 3HZZ and 3KRT) suggesting a role of the water molecule in the active enzyme complex. To test the function of these residues during catalysis, we characterized different active site variants and addressed the reaction mechanism with molecular-dynamics simulations along the minimum free-energy path within the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methodology.Fig. 1.Structure of KsCcr complexed with NADPH and ethylmalonyl-CoA. (Left) KsCcr forms a dimer of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits. The subunits are highlighted in gray and green (closed form with NADPH and ethylmalonyl-CoA, both represented in spheres) and blue and orange (open form with NADPH only, represented in spheres).

When we experimentally characterized the reaction of the N81L variant in more detail, we observed a strongly decreased carboxylation reaction, as well as accumulation of a covalent reaction intermediate, a so-called C2-ene adduct (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). C2-ene adducts are also observed in WT Ecrs when the catalytic cycle is stalled, for example when CO2 is omitted from the reaction mixture. The fact that a C2-ene adduct is observed in the reaction of the N81L variant even under saturating CO2 conditions suggests that the interaction of the enzyme with CO2 is severely disturbed by the N81L mutation. Simulations of the N81L variant revealed that most of the catalytic residues and water molecules remain in the same position, while the CO2 molecule appears increasingly disordered (Fig. 2D and Movie S2). As a consequence, the minimum energy profile from the C2-adduct to the product (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA of N81L becomes endothermic and shows significantly higher barriers for the C–C-bond formation step compared with the WT.

      "Text: ed with the WT (Table 1). Altogether, our experimental findings are well in line with the higher calculated free-energy barriers for the carboxylation step and endothermic product formation in the N81L variant (Fig. 2F), highlighting how crucial Asn81 is for correct positioning of CO2.How is the interaction of the carboxamide group of Asn81 with CO2 controlled? Analysis of the interaction network of the amino acid shows hydrogen bonding of Asn81 to 2 residues in the second shell of the active site, Thr82 and Ser119. We hypothesized that these interactions are essential in pointing the carboxamide NH2 group Asn81 toward the active site to enforce its interaction with the CO2 molecule. Indeed, the variants T82D and S119A showed almost full carboxylation, but at more than 50-fold reduced turnover frequency (SI Appendix, Table S3), demonstrating the importance of these secondary shell residues in increasing catalytic activity of Asn81. In summary, both simulation and experimental data suggest that Asn81 is crucial to position CO2 and to establish favorable interactions of the gas molecule with the enzyme during catalysis. Absence of this residue leads to lowered carboxylation efficiency and increased formation of the labile C2-ene adduct, which is not further processed by the enzyme and leaves the active site upon which it spontaneously decays in solution.Phe170 Shields the Active Site from Water.The reactive nature of the enolate that is formed during the catalytic cycle of Ccr mandates that the enolate does not get into contact with water at the active site, which would inevitably lead to its protonation and formation of the butyryl-CoA side product. A role in shielding the active site from water had been previously suggested for Phe170 (20). Simulations of an F170A variant reveal conformational changes that result in a disorganization of the active site and an increase in the number of hydration sites compared with the WT (Fig. 2; compare Fig. 2 B and H, Movie S3, and SI Appendix, Supplementary Pymol and Chimera Files 1a and b and 3a and b). These changes also perturb the interaction of the CO2 molecule with Asn81 (Fig. 2G). Accordingly, the CO2 molecule loses its favorable position for the reaction with the enolate so that both activation barriers are increased (Fig. 2I), which is in agreement with our experimental data (Table 1). In the F170A variant the carboxylation activity is decreased to 17% at the expense of increased reduction side reactivity. Unlike in the N81L variant, however, protonation takes place in F170A with almost WT stereospecificity (Table 1), confirming that in the F170A enzyme water is able to reach the active site and directly protonate the enolate.Movie S3.\n",
      "KsCcr F170ASome Ecrs feature a tyrosine at position 170 instead of the phenylalanine. When we tested an F170Y variant, the enzyme showed a slightly increased substrate inhibition, but otherwise very similar kinetic parameters as the WT. Most importantly, the F170Y variant displayed full conversion of crotonyl-CoA to (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA in the presence of saturating amounts of CO2, indicating that the presence of the hydroxyl group does not affect carboxylation activity.

      "Text: ed with the WT (Table 1). Altogether, our experimental findings are well in line with the higher calculated free-energy barriers for the carboxylation step and endothermic product formation in the N81L variant (Fig. 2F), highlighting how crucial Asn81 is for correct positioning of CO2.How is the interaction of the carboxamide group of Asn81 with CO2 controlled? Analysis of the interaction network of the amino acid shows hydrogen bonding of Asn81 to 2 residues in the second shell of the active site, Thr82 and Ser119. We hypothesized that these interactions are essential in pointing the carboxamide NH2 group Asn81 toward the active site to enforce its interaction with the CO2 molecule. Indeed, the variants T82D and S119A showed almost full carboxylation, but at more than 50-fold reduced turnover frequency (SI Appendix, Table S3), demonstrating the importance of these secondary shell residues in increasing catalytic activity of Asn81. In summary, both simulation and experimental data suggest that Asn81 is crucial to position CO2 and to establish favorable interactions of the gas molecule with the enzyme during catalysis. Absence of this residue leads to lowered carboxylation efficiency and increased formation of the labile C2-ene adduct, which is not further processed by the enzyme and leaves the active site upon which it spontaneously decays in solution.Phe170 Shields the Active Site from Water.The reactive nature of the enolate that is formed during the catalytic cycle of Ccr mandates that the enolate does not get into contact with water at the active site, which would inevitably lead to its protonation and formation of the butyryl-CoA side product. A role in shielding the active site from water had been previously suggested for Phe170 (20). Simulations of an F170A variant reveal conformational changes that result in a disorganization of the active site and an increase in the number of hydration sites compared with the WT (Fig. 2; compare Fig. 2 B and H, Movie S3, and SI Appendix, Supplementary Pymol and Chimera Files 1a and b and 3a and b). These changes also perturb the interaction of the CO2 molecule with Asn81 (Fig. 2G). Accordingly, the CO2 molecule loses its favorable position for the reaction with the enolate so that both activation barriers are increased (Fig. 2I), which is in agreement with our experimental data (Table 1). In the F170A variant the carboxylation activity is decreased to 17% at the expense of increased reduction side reactivity. Unlike in the N81L variant, however, protonation takes place in F170A with almost WT stereospecificity (Table 1), confirming that in the F170A enzyme water is able to reach the active site and directly protonate the enolate.Movie S3.\n",

When we tested an F170Y variant, the enzyme showed a slightly increased substrate inhibition, but otherwise very similar kinetic parameters as the WT. Most importantly, the F170Y variant displayed full conversion of crotonyl-CoA to (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA in the presence of saturating amounts of CO2, indicating that the presence of the hydroxyl group does not affect carboxylation activity. In summary, these experiments together with the simulations showed that the phenyl rings of phenylalanine (and tyrosine) play an important role in suppressing the reduction reaction of Ecrs by water shielding.His365 and Glu171 Coordinate an Ordered Water Molecule Interacting with CO2.Opposite of Asn81 and at the other end of the putative CO2-binding pocket the residues His365 and Glu171 are located.

These data suggest that a defect in water coordination negatively affects C–C-bond formation activity in the H365N variant. However, this does not lead to a complete hydration of the active site. Simulations of the H365N mutant revealed broken interactions of the CO2 molecule with Asn81 (Fig. 3D and Movie S4). The coordination to the ordered water molecule that bridges to Glu171 is lost, and the latter residue is rotated out of the active site disfavoring CO2 binding, which explains the experimentally observed increased KM for CO2. In our simulations, the CO2 molecule shows an increased rotational tumbling at the active site of the H365N variant compared with the WT, which is reflected by an increased rmsd for CO2 (2.4 Å versus 0.46 Å). Together, experiment and simulations indicated reduced carboxylation efficiency because of decreased control of CO2 (but not water) at the active site in the H365N variant, lowering the chances of productive Michaelis complex formation.Movie S4.\n",

In our simulations of the E171A mutant, interaction of CO2 with Asn81 is partially maintained, while Phe170 adopts the position of the mutated glutamate in the WT (Fig. 3A and Movie S5). As for H365N, the E171A variant showed increased CO2 tumbling at the active site, which is reflected by an rmsd of 2.0 Å (compared with 0.46 Å of the WT).

      "KsCcr H365NWhile H365N and E171A show a similar carboxylation behavior, the free-energy paths of the 2 variants show distinct differences (Fig. 3 C and F). In both variants, the 2 main barriers along the minimum free-energy path of the reaction––the one that leads to the enolate from the C2-ene adduct and the one that adds CO2 to the enolate––appear increased compared with the WT (for WT see Fig. 2C). This is experimentally reflected by the decreased catalytic activity of the 2 variants and can be related to a distorted water network and increased tumbling of CO2 at the active site of these enzymes. In H365N, however, the first energy barrier is higher compared with E171A. This indicates that enolate formation is disfavored and suggests that the C2-ene adduct accumulates in the H365N variant. This was experimentally confirmed by measuring the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction in the absence of CO2. In the H365N variant, stereospecificity was lost (Table 1), indicating that the H365N is additionally affected in enolate formation compared with the E171A mutant and the WT, respectively.In summary, His365 and Glu171 can partially compensate each other so that carboxylation function is maintained. However, only the combined action of the 2 residues allows full control over the CO2 molecule and thus a fast carboxylation rate.DiscussionCcr from K. setae carboxylates crotonyl-CoA at a turnover frequency of more than 100 s−1. This is almost 1 order of magnitude faster than an average RuBisCO homolog and one of the fastest CO2-conversion rates described to date. Combining X-ray crystallography, experimental biochemistry, and molecular dynamics simulations we characterized the role of individual amino acids at the active site of KsCcr in CO2 binding and C–C-bond formation. In KsCcr the active site is optimized to accommodate CO2 and at the same time exclude water to suppress the competing reduction reaction. All this is apparently achieved by only 4 amino acids: Asn81, His365, Glu171, and Phe170. The amide group of Asn81 is responsible for anchoring the CO2 from one side, while a water network organized from an ordered water molecule coordinated between His365 and Glu171 serves as an additional anchor point for CO2 from the opposite side. The aromatic ring of Phe170 side chain actively prevents the diffusion of water into the active site.Why is the CO2-fixation reaction of Ecrs so much faster but still more specific compared with the reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO, although both enzymes react through an enolate? Note that there are fundamental differences in the catalytic mechanisms of RuBisCO and Ecrs. In RuBisCO, enolization of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is achieved by abstraction of the H3 proton through an active-site carbamylated lysine, which is a reversible process and very close to equilibrium (24).

Combining X-ray crystallography, experimental biochemistry, and molecular dynamics simulations we characterized the role of individual amino acids at the active site of KsCcr in CO2 binding and C\\u2013C-bond formation. In KsCcr the active site is optimized to accommodate CO2 and at the same time exclude water to suppress the competing reduction reaction. All this is apparently achieved by only 4 amino acids: Asn81, His365, Glu171, and Phe170. The amide group of Asn81 is responsible for anchoring the CO2 from one side, while a water network organized from an ordered water molecule coordinated between His365 and Glu171 serves as an additional anchor point for CO2 from the opposite side. The aromatic ring of Phe170 side chain actively prevents the diffusion of water into the active site.Why is the CO2-fixation reaction of Ecrs so much faster but still more specific compared with the reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO, although both enzymes react through an enolate? Note that there are fundamental differences in the catalytic mechanisms of RuBisCO and Ecrs. In RuBisCO, enolization of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is achieved by abstraction of the H3 proton through an active-site carbamylated lysine, which is a reversible process and very close to equilibrium (24). (Re)protonation of the enolate yields the substrate again, which can undergo another round of activation until it reacts with a CO2 (or O2) molecule, which pulls the reaction further (25).

Additionally, however, the KM for crotonyl-CoA increased 25-fold, indicating an additional role of Glu171 in positioning the CoA substrate. In our simulations of the E171A mutant, interaction of CO2 with Asn81 is partially maintained, while Phe170 adopts the position of the mutated glutamate in the WT (Fig. 3A and Movie S5). As for H365N, the E171A variant showed increased CO2 tumbling at the active site, which is reflected by an rmsd of 2.0 Å (compared with 0.46 Å of the WT). Altogether, these results suggest that in the E171A variant, similar to the H365N variant, control of the CO2 molecule (but not water) is affected.Movie S5.\",\n",

      "    \"quote\": \"KsCcr H365NWhile H365N and E171A show a similar carboxylation behavior, the free-energy paths of the 2 variants show distinct differences (Fig. 3 C and F). In both variants, the 2 main barriers along the minimum free-energy path of the reaction––the one that leads to the enolate from the C2-ene adduct and the one that adds CO2 to the enolate––appear increased compared with the WT (for WT see Fig. 2C). This is experimentally reflected by the decreased catalytic activity of the 2 variants and can be related to a distorted water network and increased tumbling of CO2 at the active site of these enzymes. In H365N, however, the first energy barrier is higher compared with E171A. This indicates that enolate formation is disfavored and suggests that the C2-ene adduct accumulates in the H365N variant. This was experimentally confirmed by measuring the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction in the absence of CO2. In the H365N variant, stereospecificity was lost (Table 1), indicating that the H365N is additionally affected in enolate formation compared with the E171A mutant and the WT, respectively.In summary, His365 and Glu171 can partially compensate each other so that carboxylation function is maintained. However, only the combined action of the 2 residues allows full control over the CO2 molecule and thus a fast carboxylation rate.DiscussionCcr from K. setae carboxylates crotonyl-CoA at a turnover frequency of more than 100 s−1.

      "Text: reaction further (25). In contrast, in Ecrs the enolate is formed by hydride transfer from NADPH to the β-position of crotonyl-CoA (17–19). This provides a more “unidirectional” reaction path and leaves the enolate committed for a nucleophilic attack. Accordingly, Ecrs are required to carefully control the further fate of the enolate and especially to prevent its protonation, which would irreversibly quench the reaction (in stark contrast to the case of RuBisCO). When CO2 is absent from the active site of WT Ecr (18), or its positioning is disturbed (e.g., by H365N or N81L mutation, this study), the enolate is not simply transformed back into the starting substrates as in RuBisCO, but tends to collapse into the C2-ene adduct, which is in line with the idea of unidirectionality in Ecr catalysis. It might be tempting to speculate that the C2-ene adduct serves as a way to “store” the reactive enolate until a resolving CO2 electrophile becomes available, thereby increasing the overall reactivity of Ecrs compared with RuBisCOs.RuBisCO and Ecrs probably both evolved from non–CO2-fixing ancestors. While it has been speculated that RuBisCO emerged from an ancestral sugar phosphate isomerase it is thought that Ecrs evolved from a primordial enoyl-CoA reductase (6, 26). Clearly, this put more constraints onto the active-site topology of Ecrs, because unlike the CO2 fixation reaction in RuBisCO that could be simply built on top of a reversible isomerization reaction, the reduction reaction needed to be suppressed and replaced by the carboxylation reaction in the Ecr scaffold because of the unidirectionality of Ecr’s catalytic mechanism. The situation is reminiscent of 2-ketopropyl coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase that evolved within the superfamily of NAD(P)H disulfide oxidoreductases for which the enzyme also had to replace an active-site topology prone to reduction reactions by a CO2-fixing active site (11). In both cases, the active-site transformation was achieved with only little changes and notably without introduction of a competing oxygenation reaction, posing the question whether the evolutionary circumstances or the nature of the catalytic cycle of both enzymes were responsible to achieve this superior selectivity against oxygen compared with RuBisCO.In summary, our findings provide detailed insights into the molecular control of CO2 at one of nature’s most efficient carbon-fixing enzymes. These insights will be helpful in the future design of catalytic frameworks for the capture and conversion of CO2 in chemistry and biology (27), but also for efforts that aim at using Ecrs as key enzymes in the development of synthetic cycles for the sustainable and efficient fixation of CO2 (28, 29).Materials and MethodsChemicals.Crotonic Anhydride and Carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich AG, CoA trilithium salt and DNase I from Roche Diagnostics, and NADPH Na4 (98%) from Carl Roth GmbH.
