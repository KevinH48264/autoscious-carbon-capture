      "Facts: To study the switching between the open and closed forms of the ternary complex, we used computer simulations. Starting from the ternary crystal structure with NADPH and butyryl-CoA, we modeled the natural substrate crotonyl-CoA to carry out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the catalytic active enzyme (see Supplementary Methods). In our simulations, the closed subunit remained closed and maintained crotonyl-CoA in the active site when the dynamics of the substrate were restrained to maintain specific protein–substrate/cofactor interactions. However, in simulations without substrate restraints, the acyl moiety of the substrate left the active site, resulting in a conformational change of the closed subunit to the open form.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",

      "To evaluate the substrate’s flexibility in the open- and closed-form subunits, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations on a dimer of subunits A and C that account for the electronic degrees of freedom of the substrate were combined with MM simulations of the pair of dimers (tetramer) with substrates initially modeled in the open and bound closed subunits to reach longer time scales. These simulations showed that the substrate in the closed subunit had significantly lower temperature factors (B-factors) in comparison to that in the open subunit (Figures S6–S8 and Movies S1a–e and S2a–e). In the open subunit, the acyl moiety shows a high degree of flexibility in the active site, in agreement with the higher B-factors observed in crystal structures.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",

      "In summary, computer simulations and kinetic data of the triple variant indicate that coupling the dynamics of the two dimers is conferred by three conserved amino acids in ECRs from primary metabolism (E151, N157, and N218) and is essential to reach fast CO2 fixation kinetics in comparison to their counterparts from secondary metabolism that lack those residues.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Notably, when we used crotonyl-panthetheine, a truncated substrate lacking the adenosine moiety, a comparable decrease in kcat value was also observed for the WT enzyme, suggesting that substrate interactions at the adenine binding pocket indeed contribute to catalysis.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when we compared the kinetics of the WT enzyme with a truncated substrate to that of triple variant K296A/R303A/Y328F, in which adenosine binding was completely disturbed, the two variants behaved almost identically, strongly supporting the argument that binding of the adenine residue of the CoA substrate in the WT is important for high catalytic activity.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "We noticed that the substrate’s adenine binding pocket is directly followed by a loop, which carries a lysine residue (K332) that interacts with the neighboring subunit’s active site. K332 from the open-form subunit engages in a hydrogen-bonding network with the nicotinamide of the NADPH cofactor bound to the closed-form subunit through Q165 and H365 of the neighboring subunit (Figure 5d). These interactions are not observed in the active site of the open-form subunit (Figure 5d), raising the question of whether the hydrogen-bonding network connected to the adenine binding pocket might be necessary for catalysis.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "In variants K332A and Q165A, kcat was decreased by 2–3-fold, and for K332A, an additional increase in the apparent KM for crotonyl-CoA was observed, indicating some effect of these residues on the catalytic rate (as well as substrate binding in case of K332) (Table 2). When we tested these variants again with the truncated substrate analogue crotonyl-pantetheine, the catalytic activity in the Q165A variant was reduced by 4-fold, while that of the K332A variant was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the WT with a truncated substrate. More notably, the KM had not changed much between the WT and the two different variants (where it has even slightly improved), strongly suggesting that Q165 and K332 are not involved in substrate accommodation but rather synchronization of catalysis between open and closed subunits within the dimer. In conclusion, adenine binding and the loop carrying the residues K332 and Q165 are necessary to synchronize catalysis between the two subunits within the dimer to drive fast CO2 fixation in the K. setae ECR, providing the molecular basis of how catalysis might be synchronized between the open- and closed-form subunits within one dimer.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "Our structural studies of the K. setae ECR revealed unprecedented details on the functional organization of one of nature’s most efficient and fastest CO2-fixing enzymes. During catalysis, the enzyme complex differentiates into distinct functional subunits. The binding of the NADPH cofactor and substrates forces the homotetrameric apo enzyme into a pair of dimers. Each dimer is constituted of open- and closed-form subunits. In the closed-form subunits, the NADPH cofactor and CoA substrate are aligned with each other, suggesting that this is the catalytically competent state. The open-form subunits bind the cofactor and the substrate adenine rings, but the rest of the acyl-CoA substrate remains flexible and invisible in the active site. Thus, the open-subunit active sites represent a catalytically incompetent state that is preorganized for a subsequent round of catalysis. Overall, this structural reorganization of the ECR complex strongly supports the idea that the enzyme operates with “half-site reactivity”. (16−18) Catalysis is synchronized across the enzyme tetramer and alternates between the open- and closed-form subunits to increase the overall catalytic efficiency of the complex.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that half-site reactivity does not assume (or require) half-site occupancy. Indeed, all four subunits of the K. setae ECR tetramer ternary complex contain both NADPH and substrates (products). However, in the open-form subunits, only electron density for the adenine groups of the CoA thioester is observed (Figure 3g). The “half-site reactivity” is also consistent with a negative, rather than positive, cooperativity, as almost all our kinetics data indicate.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand if the conventional half-site reactivity theory can be applied to the ECR tetramer case, we created a model for the enzyme kinetics assuming positive or negative cooperativity between the pairs of dimers. Instead of treating the four subunits as independent entities, we hypothesized that the two pairs of ECR dimers would cycle through the CO2-fixing reactions in synchrony: i.e., when one dimer switches from the open–close to the closed–open states, the other dimer would do the opposite, closed–open to open–closed states. Using this model, we simulated the case with just one dimer with two subunits working in negative or positive cooperativity using the method described by Hill and Levitski (21) (Figure S12).[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",

      "When the latter is perturbed in the K. setae ECR (e.g., through triple mutant E151D/N157E/N218E or by disturbance of the adenosine binding pocket), the catalytic rate of the enzyme is severely diminished.[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00057]\n",
