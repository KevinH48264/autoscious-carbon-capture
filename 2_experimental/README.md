### 2_experimental
- Experimental. Anything goes. Typically used by researchers. I suggest namespacing by time (e.g. a new directory every month).
- Rubber-stamp approvals. Code review is optional and comments may be ignored without justification. Do not plug this into continuous integration.
- The goal of this directory is to create a safe space for researchers so that they do not need to hide their work. By passively observing research code “in the wild”, engineers can understand research pain points.
- Any research result that is shared outside the immediate research group may not be derived from experimental code.
