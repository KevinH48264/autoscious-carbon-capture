### 0_core
- Core. Libraries for reusable components like cloud data storage, notebook tooling, neural network libraries, model serialization/deserialization, statistics tests, visualization, testing libraries, hyperparameter optimization frameworks, wrappers and convenience functions built on top of third-party libraries. Engineers typically work here.
- Code is reviewed to engineering standards. Code is tested, covered by continuous integration, and should never be broken. Very low tolerance for tech debt.
- Breaking changes to core code should be accompanied by fixes to affected project code. The project owner should assist in identifying potential breakage. No need to fix experimental code.
