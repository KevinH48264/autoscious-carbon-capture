    "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQ–CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFc–CNT counter electrode between the two PAQ–CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of ∼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFc–CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQ–CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as ΔV1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as ΔV2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESI†), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQ–CNT = 1.12mPFVc–CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFc–CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T ∼ 21 °C.\n",

Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve.

A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm × 10 cm, with ∼0.2 g of P14AQ–CNT composite; at ∼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of ∼9–14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically ∼500 μm thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of ∼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01–0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase.

      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQ–CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the π-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQ–CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQ–CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = −1.21 V and E02 = −1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between ΔV1 and ΔV2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2, R = kCQ˙−CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large Damköhler number, (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 μm, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 × 10−10 m2 s−1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 M−1 s−1,37 resulting in Da ∼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time.

In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given by (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law.

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0–5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0–5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes.

      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (∼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60–70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ mol−1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ mol−1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Electrode Assembly: The assembly of the functionalized electrodes into compact adsorption devices needs to be refined. This is necessary to ensure efficient and effective CO2 capture and release, as well as to enable the integration of the ESA device into various CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Quinone Utilization: The ESA process relies on the utilization of quinone-functionalized electrodes. To maximize the efficiency of the process, it is important to achieve high quinone utilization rates. Currently, the ESA process demonstrates 60-70% quinone utilization, and further improvements are desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Faradaic Efficiency: The faradaic efficiency of the ESA process is reported to be 90%. While this is a high value, there is still room for improvement to enhance the overall energy efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Kinetics: The release of CO2 into a pure CO2 gas environment is described as facile and fast, but it requires sufficient time to account for the kinetics of the process. The kinetics of the ESA process should be carefully considered and optimized to ensure efficient CO2 capture and release.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Feed Concentration Dependency: The quinone-functionalized electrodes used in the ESA process have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration. However, it is important to ensure that the ESA process remains effective for a wide range of feed concentrations, including both typical flue gas concentrations (∼10%) and confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Techno-Economic Analysis: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the ESA carbon capture systems can be economically feasible, further analysis and consideration of various feed concentrations and applications are required to determine the actual costs, which can range from $50–$100 per tonne of CO2.\n",

Potential difference was applied across the power feed-throughs that were connected to the electrochemical cells, and the decrease and increase in pressure in the chamber, upon capture and release, respectively, was monitored using a Omega® PXM409-USBH pressure transducer with a range of 0–15 psia and an accuracy of 0.08% BSL.\n",

The stack of these cells, separated by ∼500 μm, was placed in a gas flow chamber (the experimental setup) and gas was flown past them. Mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide at ∼10 mL min−1 and various inlet concentrations of CO2 at T ∼ 21 °C were studied. The bed volume of the system was 70 cm3.

      "RESPONSE:  Approach: The approach involves a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system for carbon capture, which uses an electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode. The cell captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The key problem is the high energy requirement of 40-90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, primarily due to the activation energy barriers in the electrochemical reactions involving quinones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis: The research paper investigates the reaction kinetics of quinones in electrochemically mediated carbon capture, determining the bimolecular reaction rate constant between CO2 and radical anions of various quinones. It also explores how the identity and concentration of cationic and anionic species in the supporting electrolyte affect the reaction rate. These findings could potentially help in understanding and optimizing the reaction kinetics, which could in turn reduce the activation energy barriers and thus the overall energy requirement. However, the paper also highlights challenges in understanding the complex interplay between quinone chemistry, supporting salt composition, and electrolyte solvents, and in quantitatively determining the factors that influence the reaction kinetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rating: Given the above, I would rate it as a 3 on the Likert scale. The research paper's main findings might help solve the approach's key problem, but it is not definitive due to the complexity of the system and the challenges highlighted.\n",
