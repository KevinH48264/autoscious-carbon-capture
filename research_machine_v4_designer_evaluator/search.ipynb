It has the potential to capture large amounts of CO2 and can be deployed in various locations, making it a scalable solution.', 'opposition': 'The biggest weakness of DAC with carbon storage is its high cost per metric ton of CO2 captured. The energy consumption is also significant, requiring a substantial amount of electricity. Additionally, the storage capacity of certain methods may be limited, requiring frequent transportation and storage infrastructure.', 'limitations': {'1': {'limitation': 'High cost per metric ton of CO2 captured', 'metric': 'Cost per metric ton of CO2 captured'}, '2': {'limitation': 'Significant energy consumption', 'metric': 'Energy consumption'}, '3': {'limitation': 'Limited storage capacity', 'metric': 'Storage capacity'}}}\n",

      "However, with recent statistics putting global carbon emissions at almost 40 billion metric tonnes per year, finding a means of curbing emissions – and finding an affordable way to capture carbon – grows ever more pressing.\n",
      "What is the cost of carbon capture?\n",
      "CCS holds great promise in that it can capture up to 90% of the carbon emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. If deployed with renewable biomass, the method is also one of the few carbon abatement technologies that can be carbon negative, working to extract carbon dioxide from the air.\n",
      "While costs of different CCS projects vary depending on the source of the carbon captured, the distance to the storage site, and the nature of the storage site itself, capture is typically the most expensive part of the CCS process. As such, much of the current CCS development is concerned with lowering the cost of this element.\n",
      "The Carbon Capture & Storage Association (CCSA) estimated that the earlier CCS projects in the power sector would cost between €60–€90 per tonne of carbon dioxide abated, the equivalent of around $69-$103 per tonne.\n",
      "The association also predicted that these costs will decline to €35–€50 ($40-$57) in the early 2020s, thanks to technological advancements.\n",
      "Carbon capture cost: Can it go down?\n",
      "Some industry members have expressed the hope that CCS will follow a similar cost trajectory as another golden child of the renewable industry: lithium batteries. Over the past ten years or so, lithium ion batteries have fallen in cost by around 80%, with a Bloomberg New Energy Finance survey finding prices have dropped from around $1,000 in 2010 to current figures of around $200 per kWh. Prices are expected to continue falling to below $100/kWh by 2025.\n",
      "According to Greentech Media, if the price of carbon capture falls 12% per year, in line with the fall recorded by lithium ion batteries, this would put air carbon capture at less than $20 per metric ton by the 2040s, equivalent to an increase in gasoline prices of around 10% at current prices, or 25 cents a gallon.\n",
      "A significant breakthrough in terms of price came in July this year, when researchers from Harvard University announced their discovery of a new method to capture carbon dioxide for $94 per tonne. The research was carried out in collaboration with Carbon Engineering.\n",
      "Lead research author David Keith said: “What we’ve done is build a [direct-air capture] process that is – as much as possible – built on existing processes and technologies that are widespread in the world. That’s why we think we have a reasonable possibility of scaling up.”\n",
      "The new method pulls air through ‘contactors’ and exposes it to an alkaline liquid. The liquid is brought into the factory where it undergoes a series of chemical reactions to separate the base \n",

      "Keith told the Atlantic: “The main, near-term market is making carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels… We see this as a technology for decarbonising transportation.”\n",
      "Investment into lowering the cost of carbon capture is continuing to gain momentum, with the announcement from Harvard spurring researchers on with the promise of even lower costs.\n",
      "Most recently, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced it is pledging up to $30m in federal funding for cost-shared research and development into lowering the cost of carbon capture from coal-fired power plants.\n",

      "According to the World Coal Association, there are currently 21 large-scale integrated CCS projects currently in operation or under construction.\n",
      "On Monday, carbon capture firm Climeworks added another plant to this list, opening its third direct air capture (DAC) plant in Troia, Italy.\n",
      "The company launched its first two last plants year, one in Zurich, Switzerland and the other in Hellisheidi, Iceland. The former is capable of capturing 900 metric tonnes annually, while the latter captures 50 metric tonnes per year. The latest plant will capture 150 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, which will be converted into methane and used to power trucks running on ‘green gas’.\n",
      "Despite Climeworks’ leading role in the industry, its projects are still on the expensive side, with the cost of capturing one metric tonne of carbon dioxide between $600 and $800. However, a spokesperson for the company told Quartz that the price is expected to come down following the installation of more units.\n",

      "Most carbon capture technologies aim to stop at least 90% of the CO2 in smokestacks from reaching the atmosphere. But as the technology approaches 100% efficiency, it gets more expensive and takes more energy to capture additional CO2.\n",
      "February 23, 2021\n",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is any of several technologies that trap carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from large industrial plants before this greenhouse gas can enter the atmosphere. CCS projects typically target 90 percent efficiency, meaning that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from the power plant will be captured and stored. However, CCS could capture more CO2, and thus do more to combat climate change, if industries and governments decide not only to invest in CCS at a large scale but also to pay extra to maximize its potential.\n",
      "As good as it gets?\n",
      "Howard Herzog, a Senior Research Engineer in the MIT Energy Initiative, says that CCS projects have used 90 percent efficiency as a baseline target1 for decades because a system needs to remove at least that much CO2 to be worth the investment to build and install it, and also because 90 percent is an achievable goal. “Thirty years ago, people were still learning about the climate and how much CO2 we needed to get out. So getting 90 percent of the CO2 out of a coal plant was pretty good,” Herzog says.\n",
      "Yet meeting ambitious climate targets with this technology will require a leap forward in CCS efficiency. Consider that untreated exhaust from a coal-fired power plant can contain 300 times as much CO2 as the Earth’s atmosphere, which means capturing 90 percent of the CO2 still leaves a lot behind. Even if CCS could remove 99 percent of the CO2 from coal plant exhaust, what is left would still have a CO2 concentration equal to or higher than the atmosphere.\n",
      "Diminishing returns\n",
      "There are multiple ways to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-burning plants, such as coal power plants or factories that make cement. In the most common process, the exhaust gas is cooled and pumped into a chamber containing chemical “scrubbers” that bind to CO2 molecules. The carbon-free exhaust is then released into the air while the captured carbon is concentrated and stored. CCS has been implemented at two coal power plants (though one shuttered in 2020) and at about two dozen other locations so far.2\n",
      "To catch the last remainders of CO2 once a system passes 90 percent efficiency is equal parts engineering puzzle and economics problem, Herzog says. The closer a CCS system gets to 100 percent efficiency, the harder and more expensive it becomes to capture additional carbon dioxide. From an engineering perspective, it is easier to capture carbon from a gas with a higher concentration of CO2 because more molecules of carbon dioxide are flowing past the scrubbers. Grabbing even more CO2 once most of it is gone requires larger equipment, more time, more energy, and a bigger investment.\n",
      "While there are only a few dozen CCS projects in the world, some of them have exceeded 95 percent efficiency. Herzog says it is possible to envision the technology capturing even 98 or 99 percent of a power plant’s CO2. To realize that goal, however, power plants will have to pay a lot more for every extra molecule of CO2 they capture—which means they need stronger financial incentives to cut their carbon emissions. A carbon price would be one way to create those incentives, by taxing plants on whatever CO2 enters the atmosphere. “If you now start looking at carbon prices and you have a pretty high price, that will make it more affordable to go to higher capture percentages,” Herzog says.\n",

      "t of transport and storage, this can also vary greatly on a case-by-case basis, depending mainly on CO2 volumes, transport distances and storage conditions. In the United States, for example, the cost of onshore pipeline transport is in the range of USD 2-14/t CO2, while the cost of onshore storage shows an even wider spread. However, more than half of onshore storage capacity is estimated to be available below USD 10/t CO2. In some cases, storage costs can even be negative if the CO2 is injected into (and permanently stored in) oilfields to enhance production and thus generate more revenue from oil sales.\n",
      "Achieving deep emissions reductions in heavy industry (cement, steel and chemicals production) can be challenging for several reasons. But CCUS is a relatively advanced and cost-competitive option for dramatically cutting the CO2 emitted during the production of these essential materials. It can also be more cost-effective to retrofit CCUS to existing facilities than building new capacity with alternative technologies.In the case of cement production, where two-thirds of emissions are from chemical reactions related to heating limestone (rather than burning fossil fuels), CCUS is currently the only scalable solution for reducing emissions. And in the iron and steel sector, production routes based on CCUS are currently the most advanced and least-cost low-carbon options. Incorporating CO2 capture raises estimated costs by less than 10%, while approaches based on electrolytic hydrogen can raise costs by 35-70% compared with today’s conventional production methods. CCUS is currently the cheapest option for reducing emissions in the production of some important chemicals such as ammonia, which is widely used in fertilisers. The estimated costs of CCUS-equipped ammonia and methanol production based on natural gas are around 20-40% higher than their unabated counterparts, while the cost of electrolytic hydrogen routes is estimated to be 50-115% higher.\n",
      "For industry, CCUS technologies are among the cheapest abatement options – or the only option\n",
      "Solar and wind are set to become the largest and cheapest sources of electricity globally, but other technologies will still be needed for low-cost power systems. The growing proportion of power from variable renewables drives a greater need for capacity that is available “on-demand” to ensure the stable operation of power systems. CCUS-equipped coal- or gas-fired power plants can provide this capacity and supply electricity at any time, whether at night or on a still day.Power plants with CCUS are particularly valuable in regions with strong seasonal variations in renewable generation. The few alternatives able to manage these variations, such as large-scale hydrogen storage, are currently more expensive than CCUS. CCUS can also be a cost-efficient strategy to tackle emissions from existing coal- and gas-fired power plants. Around one-third of today’s coal and gas plants were built only in the last decade; retrofitting with CCUS can allow them to continue operation and avoid the costs of early retirement.\n",
      "CCUS can support the integration of renewables in power systems\n",
      "There is considerable potential to reduce costs along the CCUS value chain, particularly as many applications are still in the early stages of commercialisation. Experience indicates that CCUS should become cheaper as the market grows, the technology develops, finance costs fall, economies of scale are reached, and experience of building and operating CCUS facilities accumulates. This pattern has already been seen for renewable energy technologies over recent decades.Cost reductions have already been achieved at large-scale CCUS projects. For example, the cost of CO2 capture in the power sector has come down by 35% through its evolution from the first to the second large-scale CCUS facility, and this trend is set to continue as the market expands.\n",

      "Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies are critical for putting energy systems around the world on a sustainable path. Despite the importance of CCUS for achieving clean energy transitions, deployment has been slow to take off – there are only around 20 commercial CCUS operations worldwide. But momentum is building. Plans for more than 30 commercial CCUS facilities have been announced in recent years, and despite the Covid‑19 crisis, in 2020 governments and industry committed more than USD 4.5 billion to CCUS. A number of factors can explain the slow uptake of CCUS, but high cost is one of the most frequently heard. Commentators often cite CCUS as being too expensive and unable to compete with wind and solar electricity given their spectacular fall in costs over the last decade, while climate policies – including carbon pricing – are not yet strong enough to make CCUS economically attractive. As we explain in this commentary, to dismiss the technology on cost grounds would be to ignore its unique strengths, its competitiveness in key sectors and its potential to enter the mainstream of low-carbon solutions.\n",
      "The idea that CCUS is “high cost” ignores the bigger picture\n",
      "IEA analysis consistently shows that a broad portfolio of technologies is needed to achieve deep emissions reductions, both practically and cost-effectively. Energy efficiency and renewables are central pillars, but other technologies and strategies have a major role to play as well.In its recently published report, the IEA identified four crucial ways in which CCUS can contribute to a successful clean energy transition:CCUS can be retrofitted to power and industrial plants that may otherwise still be emitting 8 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2050 – around one-quarter of today’s annual energy-sector emissions.CCUS can tackle emissions in sectors with limited other options, such as cement, steel and chemicals manufacturing, and in the production of synthetic fuels for long-distance transport.CCUS enables the production of low-carbon hydrogen from fossil fuels, a least-cost option in several regions around the world.CCUS can remove CO2 from the atmosphere by combining it with bioenergy or direct air capture to balance emissions that are unavoidable or technically difficult to avoid.Limiting the availability of CCUS would considerably increase the cost and complexity of the energy transition by increasing reliance on technologies that are currently more expensive and at earlier stages of development. One such example is the electrification of very high-temperature heat furnaces used for cement production and virgin steelmaking.\n",
      "Achieving net-zero goals will be virtually impossible without CCUS\n",
      "CCUS applications do not all have the same cost. Looking specifically at carbon capture, the cost can vary greatly by CO2 source, from a range of USD 15-25/t CO2 for industrial processes producing “pure” or highly concentrated CO2 streams (such as ethanol production or natural gas processing) to USD 40-120/t CO2 for processes with “dilute” gas streams, such as cement production and power generation. Capturing CO2 directly from the air is currently the most expensive approach, but could nonetheless play a unique role in carbon removal. Some CO2 capture technologies are commercially available now, while others are still in development, and this further contributes to the large range in costs.\n",

      "In the pursuit of net zero, we cannot afford to dismiss CCUS as “too expensive”. It is the only group of technologies that can contribute both to reducing emissions in critical economic sectors and to removing CO2 to balance emissions that cannot be avoided – a balance that is at the heart of net-zero ambitions. In some sectors, including in heavy industry, CCUS is currently the least-cost or only practical option for deep emissions reductions. The relative lack of progress in deploying CCUS to date means that many technologies and applications are still at an early stage of commercialisation – and therefore at a high point in the cost curve. There is ample potential for cost reductions – the experience of wind and solar highlights what is possible – but, as with renewable energy, realising this potential will require strengthened policy support to drive CCUS innovation and deployment. The development of economic stimulus packages in response to the Covid‑19‑related economic downturn presents a unique opportunity to boost investment in CCUS and support a least-cost pathway to net zero. In our recent ETP Special Report on CCUS, we outline four high-level priorities for governments and industry to accelerate progress of CCUS over the next decade.\n",

      "THE COST OF CARBON CAPTUREJeremy David and Howard HerzogMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USAABSTRACTWe have conducted a detailed analysis of costs associated with today’s technology for CO2separation and capture at three types of power plants: integrated coal gasification combined cycles(IGCC), pulverized coal-fired simple cycles (PC), and natural gas-fired combined cycles (NGCC).The analysis was based on studies from the literature that analyzed the economics of capturingCO2 emitted at power plants. In this paper, we present a composite cost model and perform asensitivity analysis to identify the cost-drivers for capture. We conclude that with newdevelopments, CO2 capture and sequestration can become a cost-effective mitigation pathway.INTRODUCTIONFossil fuels currently supply over 85% of the world’s energy needs and will remain in abundantsupply well into the 21st century. They have been a major contributor to the high standard of livingenjoyed by the industrialized world. However, their future is clouded because of the environmentaland economic threat posed by possible climate change, commonly referred to as the “greenhouseeffect”. The major greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2) and the major source of anthropogenicCO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels. If we can develop technology to capture and sequester thefossil fuel CO2 in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner, we will be able to enjoy thebenefits of fossil fuel use throughout the next century.We have conducted a comparison of published studies from the past several years that analyzed theeconomics of capturing CO2 at Integrated coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants(six studies), Pulverized Coal (PC) power plants (four studies), and Natural Gas Combined Cycle(NGCC) power plants (four studies). MEA scrubbing of flue gas was used to capture the CO2 inthe PC and NGCC plants, but IGCC plants allow the use of more energy efficient scrubbingprocesses involving physical absorption to capture CO2 from the high pressure synthesis gas. Allstudies were made using commercially available technology and include the cost of compressingthe captured CO2 to about 100 atm for pipeline transportation. The results do not include cost ofCO2 transportation and injection, which will add about $10/tonne of CO2 avoided. Initial resultswere presented at GHGT-4 (Herzog, 1999), while detailed results of this analysis are presented inDavid (2000).COMPOSITE COST MODEL OF CO2 CAPTUREBased on our analysis of the literature studies, we developed a composite cost model for CO2capture. The cost model developed uses six independent inputs, which were extracted from theliterature studies we analyzed. Three first inputs characterize the reference (no capture) plant:• Capital cost, in $/kW;• Cost of electricity due to operation and maintenance, in mills/kWh;• Heat rate, in Btu/kWh, defined on the lower heating value (LHV) basis.We correlated the quantity of CO2 emitted (E), in kg/kWh, as a function of heat rate for a giventype of power plant (IGCC, PC or NGCC).\n",
